In this video, we'll discuss leveraging tax rates in your big time site. As a reminder, if you are integrated with an accounting system such as QuickBooks or Sage, upon integration, we can pull those tax rates into your big time site. However, if you are not integrated with an accounting system, don't worry. Big time now has the ability to allow our customers to manually add in tax rates and manage that list as opposed to submitting a support ticket and having dev add those in. Later on, I'll show you for those that are not connected to an accounting system, how to do so. But first, I want to show you how to enable tax rates in your big time site. By selecting invoicing, configure, and then defaults, at the very top, I have the ability to choose my tax type, whether I'm using no sales tax, single invoice rate, or line item rate. Once you've selected your tax type, you also have the ability to set a default tax rate at the project level by clicking into my company project list and selecting a project. If I scroll down, you'll see a new field for default tax rate, along with your list of tax rates that have come over from your accounting system or that you've manually added into your big time site. One thing to note is that if your firm is configured to use single invoice rate tax style, then the default rate applied here will apply to that invoice. However, users will still need to select which line items should be taxed. And if your firm is configured to reflect line item rate, if utilizing that specific rate style, then the default rate will apply to each line item. Before we go into invoicing, though, for those customers that are not integrated with an accounting system, I'm going to hop into a firm where I know I'm not integrated and show you where you can manage your tax rate list. By going to my company, field values, there's a new section for tax rates. Here I can add a tax rate and apply the tax name, as well as the rate percentage and to know any tax rates that I no longer want to use or show up in that list. I'm going to switch back into my firm where I'm connected with QuickBooks, just for training purposes. And we can now walk through where those taxes apply on an invoice. So if I come into invoicing configure, actually, let me take a step back, invoicing overview, I'm going to just click into my drafts because I know I have a drafted invoice in here and select the amount. From here, you will see that I have my line items, as well as my taxable column to reflect which line items should be taxed in order to calculate in the overall total, as well as my tax list down here. I can, of course, change this despite having it set up on my project. For example, if I wanted to change it to Illinois and save, it will recalculate that invoice amount based on the percentage. And I can choose to select or deselect any items that are not taxable, save, and it will update as well. One thing to know in order to get to this screen, I went into my amount field because originally it showed quantity, rate, and amount, and I just switched it to sales tax info here. Another cool thing to know is that if you are a Canadian firm and perhaps you utilize tax groups in your QuickBooks file, which are generally used to calculate and track two or more sales tax items that apply to the same sale, instead of combining those two, for example, PST and HST, on an invoice, we can separate those out. And that is just by going to invoicing, configure, PDF styles, and I already have one created, but if I click into it and I scroll down, I can choose to show tax rates as separate line items. If I have this unchecked, then it will just group my tax group that I have set up in QuickBooks and show as one line item. So once I come into invoicing, I'm going to just change it to my Canada tax group. You'll see that the tax amount increased. And if I go to preview, Canada tax rate, you'll see on this invoice that GST and PST are broken out if I scroll down. Otherwise, if I did not have that checked under my invoicing, configure, PDF styles, again, it would just show as one line item. And that is how you leverage tax rates in big time. So remember, you want to make sure that if you are set up with a QuickBooks file or Sage, that you have your tax rates set up in there. If you are not, then you'll want to make sure you have your tax rates set up under my company field values, along with making sure that you have your tax rate style set up from the invoicing configure defaults tab. Thank you.
