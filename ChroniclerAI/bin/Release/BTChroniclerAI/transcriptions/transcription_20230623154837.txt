The next report type around tasks is the task summary report. This report type is going to be important if you're utilizing task groups and subtasks within Bigtime. If you're using that additional hierarchy level within your task list and want insight to your budget driven projects at a higher level, that's where this report type would be useful. We'll walk through this report type by creating a custom task summary budget report. So to start, let's say you want to see the project name, but all the budget data rolled up into the task group as opposed to seeing that breakdown per task. Like any other report, especially like time and expense reports, the more detail you add, the more data driven insight you'll find. So next I would like to see the overall dollar budget estimate for my group tasks. So I'm going to scroll down and select this estimate field. And then the input charges that are remaining on that budget for the overall task group. So I will select that charges remaining. Then finally, we will also want to see the flip side of that coin. So we will include the total fees and expenses input to date. So I will scroll down to the total activity to date section and check this total input field. To make things easier for changing any information or making any edits to your task groups, I will actually add a drill down link to the group column that takes us directly through the corresponding projects task list. And I'll save that. I will also group this by project. Now I will publish this report. Call it task summary budget. And once this report has been published, you'll see that task group first. So say you had three different tasks in this task group, you'd see data for that overall group instead of the individual task breakdowns. We'll actually use that drill down link to highlight a project utilizing a task group. So I will click this link to take us to group number two's project task list. And now if we go into the task editor, you'll see that the design, development, internal review, and production deployment tasks all roll up into this group two task group. And that is our walkthrough of a custom task summary budget report that you can utilize to see your task group budgets at a higher level if those grainy or budgetary details are unnecessary. Thank you.
