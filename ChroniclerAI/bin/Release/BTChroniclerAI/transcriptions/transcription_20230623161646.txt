Hi there everyone. In today's session we're going to create a fixed fee invoice. This type of invoice is used to bill a client based on the tasks defined for a project. Fixed fee invoices are normally based on a project's budget, not on the time that has been billed against the project. You have the option to bill 100% of a task or a portion of it, and I'll explain both options in a moment. Fixed fee invoices can include additional charges as well, for example billing a fixed amount for time, but passing through all your expenses. Do note your fixed fee invoices can include line items that fall outside of the project's budget, but the invoicing wizard puts your entire budget history in front of you at the time you're creating the invoice, making accurate and timely billing easier. Before we begin creating the invoice, I just wanted to highlight within the project that I have already created tasks, as well as added fee budgets to those tasks. Now that we've got our tasks and budgets established, we will navigate to the invoicing overview page, and first we'll click create invoice and select the project you'd like to bill for. Then we'll select the fixed fee calculator. If you do not have fixed fee displaying in your list, make sure to click more invoice styles at the bottom to enable this calculator. Once fixed fee has been selected, we'll click next. Now on step three of the invoice wizard, under the completed column, you can select the red arrow to either select milestone billing or percent complete billing. Milestone billing means that you specify a dollar amount of the total task budget you want to bill. Percent complete means you're billing based on the portion of the task that's complete. The invoice amount will populate based on the percentage of the budget being billed. We will select percent complete. When finalizing a percent complete invoice, you can adjust information you see on each line item via this gear icon in the upper right to then toggle on or off the information most important to your billing process. You can have a whip summary of unbilled time and expenses that could be attached and cleared via this invoice. You can show the budget percentage of prior billings as well as the option to not automatically update your task completion percentages. In addition to those line item display settings, you can also adjust how the system will behave once it creates your invoice. On the left, you can clear whip for selected tasks, including any unbilled time or expenses on the invoice, marking them as billed and clearing the whip in the process. Note that this will just clear the whip from the unbilled pool, not adjust the invoice amount. You can create separate line items for expenses on invoicing. This will allow you to bill fees and expenses separately. Often project budgets are net of expenses and if you budget for fees but bill expenses separately, checking this box adds pass-through expenses to your invoice total. Populate line item notes with notes from selected tasks. That adds notes from your task details onto your invoice. And then finally, the options to bill only approved time or expenses. Finally, we will choose the tasks that we'd like to bill. You can check or uncheck any tasks that you'd like to omit or include on this invoice. By default, any tasks that are in progress are displayed on this screen. As your project managers mark tasks complete or update the percent complete field for those tasks, the system determines what still needs to be billed. Billing at a percentage of the task budget will also update the task completion percentage in the task at the project level. If we navigate back to the project and click into a task, this percent complete field is what I'm referring to. Back to the invoice. As you input percentages, the invoice dollar amounts, as you can see, are automatically calculated. You can also manually type in the amount of the line item under the this invoice field and the system auto calculates the percentage. Once you're done making your edits, you can then finalize to create your invoice and update your project's task completion percentages. A quick tip. Most of the time when you create a percent complete invoice, you'll want to include budget status data. You can do that by navigating to the desired PDF style, scrolling down to this third section, selecting budget status, and including these budget status details. This will give you an array of budget detail options to include on the invoice when utilizing this PDF style. I will save this, clear out, navigate to my preview. Select that PDF style, save my changes, and you can now see this budgetary information from the invoice. Well, that completes our walkthrough of creating fixed fee invoices. You should now feel comfortable utilizing the fixed fee calculator to bill a specific dollar amount or percentage of your task budgets. Thank you.
