I know we've been talking a lot about filters and I do like to highlight them so frequently because you can utilize similar filters on different report types. Like let's say for example I'm a financial admin and want to see all the time entries that have already been attached to an invoice. In that case I'm going to create my own report and start with a timesheet detail type report. First, I will add the project name, the staff member name. If you care about any of these other fields like task or category you can add those as well. I'm also going to add the date field so I know the date of the time entries. Scroll down a bit more to the time section so I can input those actual input hours. Maybe I also want to add the invoice number to see exactly which invoice that entry was attached to. Then on that invoice number column I'm going to add a drill down link to open directly to that invoice. Just because this isn't an invoice type report doesn't mean that I can't access the invoice directly from this time type report. Then on the input hours column I'm going to add another drill down link to open up directly to the time entry details. Let's save that. Back to adding more columns. Because this is for invoice data I want to see what the actual billable charges were. So I'll include that from the time section. I also want to add the cost to compare against those billable charges. I want to see some margin data as well so I will search that term and include the margin monetary field. Get rid of that search to get all the available columns back. And finally I'd like to point out that all of these yes, no type fields are really helpful for filtering. You saw that on the task type report where I added the my task yes, no column specifically for filtering. I'm going to scroll down and add this invoice status yes, no field for the very same reason. Now that I've added all the columns I want to, I'm going to group the report by navigating options, customize grouping, and group the report by project and add that subtotal. Then I'll create the filter by navigating options, customize filtering. The filter will read out as that invoiced yes, no column equals yes. This will then show all the time entries that have been invoiced. Update the report, create the report, give it a name, and publish your report. Let me change the date really quick as I have no invoice time for this month. Run that. And now I can see all the time entries that have been invoiced for each individual project filtered by this specific date range. I can see the invoice number that they're attached to as well. And because I added the drill down link, I can open directly to that invoice if necessary. The nice thing about the drill down links is it opens to a completely new tab. So I have direct access to the report still. And just like the invoice number, clicking the input hours will also bring up the edit time entry details pop up because of those drill down links. Helpful tip, if that time entry has been attached to an invoice, that information will be at the bottom of the entry on the pop up screen. You can use that same yes, no filter type if you want to see all the unbilled fees as well. That way you don't have to go to the invoicing WIP screen. You can see that by using the same filter, invoiced equals yes, and changing that yes to a no. You should now feel comfortable utilizing yes, no filters to pull a desired data set in a report like this invoice time entries report. Thank you.
