Hi there everyone. Now that we've completed our time and expense setup, we're ready to begin invoicing. During this session, we will cover the basic elements of invoicing in big time, including the invoicing overview page, your default invoice settings, and the various fields found on each invoice. To begin, we'll take a look at the invoicing dashboard by navigating Invoicing, Overview. Now you'll see a dashboard labeled with three different tiles. First we have our Work in Progress or WIP tile. This is going to be all unbilled time and expense that gets tracked for your clients and projects that are considered billable. I'll click into the tile. From here you can create an invoice, or you can click directly into the WIP to generate an invoice. You can search for a specific project via this search bar. I can also set a live filter similar to the project and staff dashboards. Also, here is the gear icon, which allows you to add, rearrange, or remove columns from your WIP view. Advanced filters can show you WIP from a specific date range, project or invoice type, by project team lead, or show only approved time or expenses. Finally, you have the ability to export this WIP by project list into PDF or XLS format. Our drafts are those invoices that you're still working on and have not been marked as posted, sent, paid and closed, or disputed. If I click into drafts, you'll see those statuses here. Also, by checking these boxes, you can apply bulk actions to these invoices, like beginning the review approval process, posting them in bulk to your accounting system, updating some additional fields like PDF style or status. Bulk marking is paid. Typically, if you've brought invoices in from a data import, you can mark those as paid in bulk to create revenue. Bulk print, create a snapshot of the invoice to compare edits against. Email, consolidate if the invoices are drafted on the same day. Note anything highlighted in gray means they're part of a consolidated invoice, like if you're sending a comprehensive invoice to a client with multiple projects. Finally, you can delete the invoice, dropping those entries back into your WIP. You can also configure your column layout via this gear icon on the right, as well as apply any advanced filters similar to your WIP tile. Once you go through your invoicing workflow, that drafted invoice will then move into your finals tile, meaning the invoice has been emailed out of big time, posted to your accounting system, or paid and closed for that current calendar month. The AR aging tile contains all invoices with an open balance. It will let you know how much AR is currently due or past due, as well as the total amount of unpaid invoices. Click into each tile to view the projects and invoices that add up to those displayed figures. Then when I scroll down, you'll see a visual representation of your monthly invoicing summary. Hovering on the bar graph will show the billed and paid amounts for those months, and clicking the bar graphs will take you to the final invoices for that month. If I go back to my invoicing overview, there are a few settings I'd like to highlight by navigating invoicing, configure in the navigation bar. Here you have your name and address info. This will appear at the top of your invoices. You can also upload a logo to appear on those invoices, as well as see a preview of its possible positioning on those invoices. Under defaults, we can configure various default settings in order to mimic your organization's billing workflow. For example, tax type, you can select no sales tax, an overall single invoice rate style, which is pulled from your field values or accounting system, or if you're in the UK, Australia, or Canada, you can also select line item rates, where each line item can have a different tax rate. You can choose the expense style of your invoices. It will default to the full expense amount, or you can choose the net expense. Similar to project auto-numbering, you can set up invoice auto-numbering, and the next time you generate an invoice, this will be that next auto-incrementing number based on the format that you choose. You also have the ability to enforce unique invoice numbers, so BigTime will recognize any duplicates in your system. Locking the billing rates prevents billing rates from being updated on or before this date, useful if you update bill rates frequently without billing first. Within our invoice tile settings, related to your invoicing dashboard, you can configure which invoice statuses populate in the drafts and AR aging tiles. There's also the ability to round. It will default to the invoice total, or you can select by line item. You can also click here to learn more about this setting via our knowledge base. If you are a law firm, we also have the ability to enable Leeds billing export format if this box is checked. We can now move to the calculators tab. Out of the box, BigTime populates your BigTime site with a few different invoicing calculator styles. You have the ability to generate a manual invoice. For example, if a project is completed, you send out an invoice, but perhaps you forgot to bill for miscellaneous, untracked items. You can create a manual invoice, ignoring any billable time or expenses from the system. Our most popular invoice type is time and materials. This creates an invoice based on the hours multiplied by the billing rates you've set up and the expenses. We have a fixed fee calculator to utilize if you're strictly billing on the budgets set up at the task level, whether that is a percent complete style or progression billing. We also have our item based billing calculator, which is useful when you're doing a mix of T&M, progression, milestone, or retainer billing all on one invoice. Then if you're utilizing the project budget style, which is a premier feature, you can turn on the project monthly fee invoice calculator as well. If you can't find what you're looking for, you do have the ability to look at our big time gallery of specialized calculators, or if you're a premier user, you can create your own custom calculator by clicking create new. PDF styles determine what your invoice is going to look like to your client. Similar to the calculators, there are a few PDF styles we've pre-made for you, such as the detailed multi-page time and expense to include all line items as well as time and expense details, invoice line items, a summary only, and a time and expense detail only template as well. You can also select create new at the bottom to make your own template from scratch. This is the PDF template creation wizard. I've had clients with customers that each require different fields on their invoices, so do know that you can make as many templates as you would like. We'll dive into the customization of a PDF template in future sessions. Similar to the calculators, you can toggle the templates on and off as well. Now onto our email settings. If you were emailing that invoice out of BigTime, you have the ability to set defaults so all clients when they receive those emailed invoices can see the sent from name, the sent from email, and if they have any questions, you can include a reply to email as well. You can also set up your invoice email details if you'd like to pre-populate a customized message. BigTime gives you the ability to do so. I typically recommend keeping these pre-filled handlebar syntaxes as it is pertinent information that will populate in every emailed invoice. Otherwise, you can also include other details found in these field hyperlinks in the event that there are other data fields that you would like to automatically pull into your invoices. Invoice reminder emails. If you have clients that may not pay on time, you can send up to three reminder emails on specific days before and or after their due dates. You should click into each reminder to designate its specific number of days as well as customize the message. This setting is supplemented by the checkbox at the bottom of your project's client tab denoting if you'd like that specific client to receive these reminders or not. Lastly, is the payments tab. I briefly mentioned BigTime Wallet during the project setup, but BigTime has the ability for you to send out invoices and collect and process payments faster all in one system using BigTime Wallet. If you do have any questions, you can always reach out to your designated BigTime resource. With BigTime Wallet, you do have the ability to customize what your client sees if you invite them to their client portal as well as setting up your accounting system so when a payment comes through BigTime Wallet, we can send it to your system for your AR to update. Then in defaults, you can select the different payment methods you allow for processing. Let me go back to the invoicing overview. In the top left, you'll see a few options, one of which is to create an invoice. Otherwise you can click directly into your WIP tile and create an invoice from there. You can also update your bill rates. By clicking yes, we will apply your current billing rates to all unsubmitted and unbilled time. Remember, only billable time that has been submitted will go directly into your WIP. You also have the ability to enter a payment within BigTime. From here, I can select my client, I can enter the amount of that payment, I can choose the payment type, you can include a reference number as well as include the payment date and some notes. You can also tell BigTime that this payment can be applied to any of the client's projects, selected from the dropdown which project you want to apply those payments to. You'll also notice at the top if a project has an account credit balance, if they've overpaid for the ability to apply that credit to an invoice. Payments made in BigTime will sync to your accounting system and you also have the ability to import invoice payments made in your accounting system via your integration settings. This negates the need to log invoice payments in both locations. Do note to export and import the invoice payments, the invoice must have originated in BigTime then pushed to your accounting system. You should now feel comfortable navigating through your invoicing tabs, configuring your default settings and activating the different billing options your organization utilizes. Thank you.
