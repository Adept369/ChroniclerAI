Hey there, everyone. Today as the first step on the road to running a smarter, more productive, and more profitable business by utilizing big time, we're going to take a look at your company's firm settings. More specifically, your company profile information, lexicon, active features, multi-location holiday calendar, and display settings. Now right off the bat, the site I'm showing may look a bit darker than some people's. That's because I'm currently utilizing the dark UI. We do have both a light and a dark UI, and you can toggle between the two by navigating to the person icon in the top right corner, clicking my profile, and then selecting between dark or vibrant mode. Then you'll just go ahead and save those changes and refresh your browser to make sure those changes take hold. Now onto the firm settings. In order to access your company's firm settings, we're going to select my company from the navigation bar, and my company again from the dropdown list. Here on the company info page is where you can enter the information or regards to your business profile, such as your company's name, address, and phone number. You can also add a company logo. As you can see here, if we hover over the eye icon, the logo size is 500 kilobytes and is best viewed if uploaded as a square. Scrolling down a bit, we can set the home time zone of your company, as well as determining the date format that your firm uses, whether that's month, day, year, day, month, year, or the option to rely on your browser's default settings. Good thing to note here is whenever you're changing tabs or pages, it's a best practice to always save your work. Now let's jump into the lexicon sub tab. Here is where you'll be able to customize big time to speak the language of your current business practices. We can rename customers, projects, tasks, such as how I've changed customer to client. I've seen people change project to jobs and tasks to engagements. We can also change team members, team leads. As you can see, I've changed project manager, labor codes, the short version of the labor code. The professional fees and expenses fields are the line items that would show up on a time and materials invoice, should you choose to not subtotal the invoice by anything like tasks, staff, or labor code. Scrolling down, you can rename the titles of your cost centers and rename your billing rate labels. Let's rename our billing rate one to standard rate. All we need to do then is simply save these changes. And to see where that permeates throughout the system, we will navigate my company, staff list, pick any one of those employees, scroll down on this basic info tab to the billing rates section, and now you can see that rate A has changed to standard rate. Going back to the firm settings, we'll take a look at the active features now. If you're a system administrator, you can hide big time features that your firm doesn't use. For example, if you're not invoicing out of big time, then you can turn it off and big time will then hide that tab. Save that, close this out, refresh the page, and you can now see that the invoicing functionality is no more. We'll go ahead and turn that back on, save our changes. And to see quick descriptions of what each feature does, just go ahead and click the question mark icon at the end of the line, and that'll give you the description right there. A quick note, available features will vary from tier to tier, and what we're looking at here specifically is the premier tier of available features. Now we're going to go to our holidays tab. Here's where system admins can specify holidays for their firm. These holidays will be removed from their firm's capacity. Holidays can also be assigned to specific call center groups, such as location. Select the call center from the list below that you'd like to leverage when creating holidays. I'm going to select location, and now the call center values you choose from that list will now appear in this group column that just popped up. You'll see here that we can then assign this holiday to a specific location or to multiple groups. Holidays with no group, however, will be applied to all staffers within your firm. Lastly, we'll take a look at your display settings. There is now the option to configure which tabs are displayed across the top of your projects. The system administrator will select which eight tabs they want to be at the forefront of their projects. The remaining three will fall under the ellipses tab. You are required to have at least eight tabs displayed, and as we can see here, it is grayed out and has a red ring around it. Project details is a required selection. Also to note, this is a universal configuration and applies to all users. To take a look at how these display settings have permeated throughout the site, we'll go ahead and save, close out, go to my company project list, click into any of these projects that I have, and these are those eight tabs from your display settings along with the ellipses tab with the three dots that houses those unchecked three options of billing history, budget status, and time and expense history. That is all we have for establishing your firm settings within BigTime. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.
