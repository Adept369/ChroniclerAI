Welcome to BigTime Wallet, our secure online payment processing solution. In the following courses to come, you'll learn all about configuring and setting up BigTime Wallet in order to effectively process and collect payments. But first, I'd like to take a step back and talk about what BigTime Wallet is. Just like you and the rest of our customers, you need to get paid for the work that you and your team have dedicated their time to. Once you send out an invoice, you eagerly await to get paid. However, it can take a while if you're waiting for checks to come in the mail or your client is deciding on the best payment option. With BigTime Wallet, you can provide your clients with a personalized and branded experience to pay on time from anywhere with just one click. BigTime Wallet provides your customers the flexibility to pay via credit card or ACH direct from their inbox with payment links that are PCI compliant. This is great for your clients, but what does this mean for you? Moving forward, you can stop worrying about the hassle of switching between invoicing and payment processing software all while getting paid faster. If all of this gets you excited like it does for us, then we encourage you to reach out to your AE, Implementation Manager, or CSM to get started.
