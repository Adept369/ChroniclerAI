Hi there everyone. Now that we've completed staff setup, we're ready to move on to project setup. During this course, we will be walking through how to set up a project, the different fields that will be important to complete, setting up your project teams, your bill rate structure, creating tasks and assigning budgets, as well as taking a look at the financials of the project. One thing to note, throughout this course I may be utilizing a specific term that differs from your company lexicon, for example, tasks are often called engagements or phases, no matter the functionality operates the same way. First we'll navigate my company project list. This is going to give you a view of your project dashboard. You'll see your project name, the project number, the current production status of this project, whether it's in process, on hold or inactive, any status notes, for example, if a project's on hold, you can see why at a high level, and then billing status. Anything that's denoted as in process means that you're actively billing for that project. Just like your staff view, we will only show you those active projects unless you select to include inactive and completed projects. Now before we get to adding a project, on the right there are a few additional settings. The question mark icon will give you a quick description of your currently displayed columns. You can also change the view of your project dashboard. For example, it's currently set to show by project, meaning the client is in bold text and the project name is a blue hyperlink underneath. Your client project structure will normally determine which view is better, the project view or this flat view. If you have a client with multiple projects, you will typically use the project view. However, if you only operate on that customer level, this flat view is a device. This view is specifically used if you do not work on a multi-project level. I suggest also taking a look at your previous system to see your project structure, but just know we do work on a standard client project hierarchy. Therefore, every client in the big time system has at least one project, even if you are utilizing that flat view. You also have the ability to use live filters similar to the staff view. The gear icon also allows you to include, rearrange, or remove additional columns you don't already see. You can include extra info you'd like to see at a glance, such as the project's base rate. We'll go ahead and apply that. Please note that any of those changes to the columns are global changes, so if another user has access to the project list, they will also see those additional columns. Then in the event that I need to update the base rate of some projects, I can go into bulk actions, then either select them all by clicking this name checkbox, or just selecting a few and then clicking update. And now you see the many fields you can update in one click. All the fields you're seeing here are coming directly from the project setup, which we'll be going over today. We also give you the ability to export your list to PDF or Excel, as well as expand your screen by clicking these arrows. On the left side, you can also search for a specific project by typing the name in this box. Now I want to demonstrate how to add a project. There are three ways to add a project in BigTime. Manually adding via this add project button, importing them via an integration to your accounting system or CRM like QuickBooks, Sage, Jira, Salesforce, or HubSpot, and lastly via a paid data import that BigTime would facilitate on our backend. Today let's just walk through the manual option by clicking the add project button. First you can add just a client, just a project if you already have a client that exists in BigTime, as well as add a new client and project together. For today's purposes, I'm going to add a client and a project. I will call the client BigTime Academy and the project BigTime Building Blocks. You also have the ability to set up auto-numbering for your project codes. You click this edit auto-numbering and hover over this eye icon. You can also see the possible formats you can instill for your auto-numbering. You can also apply a project template when manually adding a new project. Project templates allow you to pre-define data fields like basic settings, tasks, rates, teams, and more. You have the ability to save an existing project as a template, but cannot apply a template to a project post-creation. Turn on templates in your active features tab in the My Company, My Company menu. Project templates will then be available to create in your My Company dropdown after a refresh of your browser. If you have a project manager that's adding a project in BigTime but doesn't have the user right to view all projects, then this PM must add themselves to the project team by checking this box. Otherwise, when logging in, they wouldn't see this new project in their project list. Then I'll go ahead and select add, and your project has been created. Now we'll dive into each of the tabs as they relate to project setup. First we'll take a look at the details tab. One thing to note, if you are adding projects in BigTime and they don't live in QuickBooks or Sage yet, you'll see a notice on the right-hand side saying this project hasn't been added yet, would you like to add it? Once you select yes, BigTime will push that project to your accompanying system and automatically create that customer job link right down here. That way, if you post time, expenses, or invoices, BigTime will push that information to the correct location in your other system. You also have the ability to bring in your customers and sub-jobs from QuickBooks or Sage into BigTime. I typically recommend the workflow of creating your jobs in BigTime, then pushing to QuickBooks or Sage, because you get more detail on the project in BigTime. One difference between QuickBooks Desktop and Online, I'd like to point out, is that we don't connect to the projects module of Online, so if you do push from BigTime to QuickBooks Online, projects will push over as sub-customers. If you'd like to keep the project hierarchy you currently have in QBO, I'd suggest creating projects there, then bringing them over to BigTime. Now let's dive into the specific fields. First we have the project name, the ID that populated from the auto-numbering, the display as name, which follows your project naming conventions set in a timesheet. We also have budget style. Today we're going to focus on standard by task, but as you move on, we'll also review the project budget, which is important when it comes to fixed fee type projects and auto-generating draft invoices. Project budget is also a premier feature. If you hover over this question mark icon, you will see a short description of those two styles. Then we have project type, filled with the options from your field values list. Allow everyone to build time and expense to this project. If you have restrictions on what your staffers can see, for example they can only see the projects they're assigned to, but you'd like everyone to see this specific project, you should go ahead and check this box. You can also denote a project as non-billable. Typically, I see both of these boxes checked for an internal project, like admin work or PTO, vacation, or sick time, anything you don't bill out but would still like to track. None of the time or expenses tracked to this project would go into your WIP then on your invoicing overview page. Your current status is either active or inactive, then you have a few sub-values under those headings. One thing to note about your production status is that a project must have an inactive status so staffers can no longer select that project on their timesheet. However, if that project is already on the staffers timesheet, you can also set a due date so staffers cannot continue to track time to that project, as well as we have status notes for any relevant status information. Billing status directly relates to your WIP, so any project that's designated as inactive, none of those time or expenses logged will go into that invoicing overview WIP tile. As mentioned, you can include a start and due date for a project. Then we have our cost centers. Cost centers are great for reporting purposes and are completely customizable via your company lexicon and then the pick list options via the field values. QuickBooks customer job link, if you bring in a project from QuickBooks to BigTime, we will automatically link it for you. BigTime will also automatically create this link if you add a job in BigTime first, then push it to your accounting system. This link is very important for posting the time, expenses, and invoices to the correct customer and sub-job in your accounting system. Also so BigTime doesn't create any duplicates in your BigTime site. Default class pulls right from your QuickBooks file. Category list, you have the ability to limit the categories available for your staffers to track against on their timesheet. If you leave this category list blank, all categories will be available to track against this project. We also have default category, so if you know this project should always be logged to architectural design, then when logging time, this default category will automatically attach itself to every entry. These three default fields of tax rate, invoice type, and invoice PDF are going to automatically apply their specific assets to any invoice created for this project. Their typical use case is when generating bulk invoices. Do note, if your firm uses the line item tax rate style, then the default tax rate will apply to each line item on the invoice. Notes are going to be internal notes about the project. Default invoice notes allow you to automatically include this note when generating an invoice for this project, for example, like a personalized thank you. Then these default invoice notes will auto-populate onto the invoice for this project, but do know that you'll also be able to edit or create a new note on the invoice itself. And similar to staff profile, you also have the ability to add custom fields. One thing to note, if you utilize PO numbers, we can create this custom field to automatically pull this value onto any invoice you create for this project. Though, do note this is the only custom field you can create that will auto-pull onto invoices. Don't forget to save your changes. Here you can also see how we would save this project as a template. Also similar to staffers, we can delete, deactivate, and merge projects in the event you have duplicate projects or want to inactivate a project, but keep the data in the system. Remember you can't delete a project if there's any time, expenses, or invoices logged to it. Now we can move to our client tab. Here's all the info on your client. If you've brought in those projects from QuickBooks, we will import some of this client info. You can also determine if this client should have their invoices consolidated, if they have multiple projects, and whether or not they receive invoice reminders to pay their invoices. If you have a billing contact set up in QuickBooks, we will pull that into BigTime. Otherwise, if I select add contact, you can choose the contact's role on this project. Do note that you can only have one billing and one primary contact per project, but as many others as you'd like. The client portal relates to invoicing and BigTime Wallet as a way to receive payment faster for your invoices. Now onto our financials tab. This will give you overall project history of time and expenses drilled down by a time period. On the right, you can also add in report views from the report center as long as the report is configured to select a specific project, which we will cover in future courses. There's also a new user right that will deliberately hide this tab from people who manage the projects as well. The team tab allows you to assign people to your projects, necessary for staffers that do not have the user rights to log time and expenses to every project. You have the ability to add team members or copy a team from an existing project. And if you do have a default role denoted on the staff profile, that will populate here. Or you can always just go ahead and manually assign them. You can also denote someone as a team lead. You can have as many as you'd like. Team lead can have access to approving timesheets, expenses, and invoices, as well as populating reports based on the projects that person leads. If you recognize certain people consistently working together on projects, you can also add an entire staff team, as opposed to assigning individual staffers one by one to a project. We can click save. Now we can move on to rates. Bill rates are going to be crucial for logging time and expenses, as well as invoicing. In the basic billing rates section, you have the ability to select the base rate type to calculate time against, whether that is a staff rate, a category rate, or a project flat rate. Remember, on the staffer page, you can include five billing rates. If you are tracking any time, it is important you're selecting the right base rate type at the time of project configuration. You also have the ability to set up custom billing rates. For example, although I have staff rate A selected, there might be a time when you have some staffers being billed at a different rate based on the project. By clicking add rate, you can assign custom rates via any combination of these three criteria fields, by staff member or role, by the category, as well as by the task if you have those set up at the project level. This will then tell BigTime instead of utilizing staff rate A, if Brian logs time using the artwork category, then you'll utilize a bill rate of $5. You also have the ability to copy custom rates from existing projects using this copy button. I'll save my changes. On the right, you can also create custom rate cards. Rate cards are used to share custom billing rates across multiple projects. If I click into the dropdown, then edit values, and into the example card one, you'll see you can set up common rates on various projects based on the staff member or role, as well as the category to then determine the specific amount that should be used. You can save, and then once you're back on the rates tab, you can then select the card from the common rates dropdown. And do know that custom rate cards override custom billing rates, and custom billing rates override base rates. If nothing custom is applied, the project will default to the base rate type. Also, do know that if you are a premier user, you have the ability to create custom cost rates as well as custom expense rates at the project level. Now we can move on to our tasks. Tasks are a great way to organize your project by specific units of work. They're the key to setting project budgets, schedules, and assignments. Tasks can be grouped into subtasks, established as one-time events, or as a recurring series. Tasks can also be included on invoices and featured in reports to get better estimates and track budget statuses. If I wanted to add a task, I'll navigate to the task editor subtab, and I'll go ahead and add the task called budget one. I can assign estimated budgets in these fees and or hours columns that will pull onto an invoice when billing with a fixed fee or item-based calculator. I'll put in a 250 fee budget with a 30 hourly budget. You can include start and due dates for these tasks as well as assigning tasks to specific staffers. If the assignment is left blank, anyone can track to that task, but if it's assigned, only the assigned staffer will have the ability to log time or expenses to that task. Start and due dates also come into play in the Gantt chart feature found under the schedule subtab. I'll go back to the editor, go ahead and add a budget two task. Then I'm also going to add a subtask. If I add a budget to that subtask, it will roll up into this main task as you can see. I can also, in the bottom left, add a recurring task. These are helpful for ongoing work and roll up into the master series task of this recurring task. Call it recurring. Task types and statuses are configured in the workflow configure types subtab in the navigation bar. I will give it a contractor status that is in process, not assigned to anyone. Start date of today. We will give it an end date of same time next year. And then I will have this task recur monthly. And I can also extend this out for two years once the series has actually been completed. Then I'll go ahead and save. Now you can see we now have this recurring task. And when I add the recurring task, you'll see this red marker in the upper left corner denoting that this task is recurring. When adding a recurring task, make sure the budget is broken down to a monthly level and not a comprehensive level so you can bill out the correct amount each month. Then clicking the three dots will give you some additional options, much like editing the task. So if you wanted to, say, change any of this general info, you absolutely could. In the budgets and dates, you could either archive this task or you can also include a task follow up to notify certain parties of the task status. Along with on the accounting subtab, you can select the fee type for use with the item based invoice calculator. The gear icon will allow you to add, remove, or rearrange fields in the task editor. And checking this box at the bottom will either hide or reveal your completed tasks for this project. By navigating my company notifications, you can also turn on assignment notifications that will send alerts to the staff when assigned to a task or a project. You can also turn on budget status notifications, which will send alerts to certain parties on any updates made to their tasks. Going back to the project, we'll take a look at the task overview status subtab to see a high level overview of your tasks and a varying amount of pertinent information selectable in this dropdown on the right side. The allocations tab is for allocating your resources at a staff or task level, useful for projecting revenue and utilizing your staffers effectively. Note this is a premier feature and is supplemented by the utilization dashboard and planning board under this workflow tab in the navigation bar. We'll dive into those in another session. The activity tab is similar to staff profiles as it's not tied to any monetary value, just some quick to-dos you can assign to your staff members. And then these three dots will show your billing history to see any invoices or payments generated for this project. Your budget status tab, which is a helpful to-date snapshot of your project's task budgets. And finally, the time and expense history tab, which diverts you back to this financials tab. Now, let's pop to our vitals tab. The vitals tab provides a comprehensive view of a project's progress, status, and overall health. The metrics available will give admins and PMs a visual snapshot of the project's current performance, any top performers or possible struggles, as well as useful financial data. The charts highlight task statuses, the budget status, billing realization to date, an hour's scorecard, as well as data metrics and insights. To get a brief description of each chart, click the question mark icon in each tile. The project's health will also be either green, yellow, or red, depending on your project's task burn-up and budget progress. That completes our session on project setup. By now you should feel comfortable creating a project in big time or bringing those projects in from another system, as well as creating task budgets from your task editor. Once you have your project set up, it's then time to configure your time and expense sheets so you can then invoice accordingly. Thank you.
