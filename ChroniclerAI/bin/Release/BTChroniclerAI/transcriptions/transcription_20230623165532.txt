Hi there, everyone. During today's session, we'll walk through the staff list setup of your big time site. By the end of today, you should feel comfortable with all the fields in the staff profile along with importing staffers from QuickBooks or Sage, or adding those staffers manually in big time and then linking to their corresponding profile in your accounting system. To begin, we're going to select my company staff list. This is your staff dashboard. Here you'll see a few columns with different headers, two of which I like to provide a distinction between. Status is the current standing of that staffer at your firm, while account status refers to the staff's current standing within big time. Anyone active has created their credentials and logged into big time. Not invited means they haven't been sent an invitation email or created their credentials. To invite a staffer to big time, go into their profile and click the email invite hyperlink. This will email the staffer and invite them to create their big time credentials. We will never automatically invite staffers. You must click the email hyperlink. I suggest inviting staff once you're confident in your site configuration. You can work with your implementation manager on a defined go live as to when you'd like staff to start tracking time. Back in the staff dashboard, there's two ways of getting staff into your big time site. One is importing them from your QuickBooks or Sage intact file. Otherwise, you can click add staff and enter their basic info, then either add or add an invite to send that invitation email. Just make sure after you've created their profile, you've linked them to the correct profile in QuickBooks or Sage, which we'll touch on in a second. There's a few other items in the staff dashboard, one of which is the gear icon that controls the selected fields you like on your dashboard. One example is if you need to arrange staff by location, you can include that column. Then you can click on that column to sort them accordingly. These columns are also a system wide setting, so everyone will have the same columns if their permissions grant them visibility to the staff list. Live filters let you hone in on a specific search within each column or use the search bar to easily identify a staffer. Skill search allows you to hone in on these staffers with specific qualifications. Do note that skills is a premier feature that needs to be turned on in your site's active features. Big time also provides you with a description of each column via this question mark icon. Now the staff list defaults to only show active staffers unless you check this box to include inactive staffers denoted by their status. Now let's dive into a staff profile. You'll see the basic info comes first like their first and last names and email address. This email says example.com because this staffer was imported from QuickBooks, however there was no email attached to that staffer in QuickBooks. If that happens, just make sure that you update the email here, save your changes, and then invite the staffer with the correct email. You can denote their status. Any field values pick lists we covered in the previous video will also have this quick edit values shortcut that takes you directly to the appropriate sub tab in the field values menu. Title is a reference point for the position they hold at your organization. Default role comes into play in two areas, one of which is on the project team of a project. If they work most of the time in a specific role, we will auto populate the default role when you add that staffer to the project team of a project they're working on. Another way default role is used is in resource allocation, which is a premier feature. Resource allocation allows you to filter staffers by default role and use roles as placeholders until you decide who is the best fit for that project. Lead time also provides you with suggestions based on that default role and capacity for future forecasting and planning. As I scroll down, if you're connected to QuickBooks or Sage, these four fields will populate minus payroll item for Sage. Under this employee dropdown is everyone you currently have in QuickBooks or Sage. If you're manually adding staff, they also need to be in your accounting system with the same email so you can link these accordingly. That way, no duplicate profiles will come over. And the same with vendors. If you work with any 1099 subcontractors and consultants, you can link your staffer to a vendor, which allows you to generate vendor bills from time tracked on behalf of that vendor. As long as this post time as bill functionality is turned on, also make sure to have vendor bills turned on in your active features as well. If you utilize payroll items in QuickBooks Desktop, you can carry over those payroll items as well. For QuickBooks Online, we do not pull over payroll items. And QuickBooks classes also come over as well. The budget and management settings fields are accessible to system administrators. These go hand in hand with our utilization dashboard along with resource allocation. Big time auto populates 160 hours equating to eight hours a day, five days a week, four weeks a month. That'll denote someone as full time, whereas part time could be 80. Cost rate is a field that allows you to look at profitability. One thing to note is that this will be broken down hourly. So I always suggest utilizing a loaded cost rate or fringe rate, which would include any overhead labor or benefits in order to accurately pull profitability reports. Employment start and end dates directly impact the utilization dashboard for premier users. For example, if you don't want a staffer in the utilization dashboard, make sure to enter an end date. And if you want a full time staffer to show the same capacity among the rest, make sure start dates align or adjust accordingly. Department is specific to time and expense approvals, specifically if you have a manager overseeing a specific department at your organization. And manager is specifically related to our Sage intact integration. Otherwise, it's just a reportable point of reference. You can adjust the home time zone for remote staffers and you can default the staffer to a specific category, automatically filling in the category field on their time sheets whenever time is logged. Billing rates are very important because that's how you tell big time what to calculate input hours by. From a project level, you can have a project set up by staffer rates, a project flat rate, or a category rate. But I always encourage some sort of rate to be filled in here so you can pull reports, especially when using fixed fee projects, so you can accurately see if you'd have made more on a fixed fee or a time and materials project. Remember, you can always change the lexicon to make these rate labels applicable to your firm. Big time cost centers are normally utilized for reporting purposes, especially in the event you'd like to run a cost analysis. For example, you can run reports based on locations, seeing who's underperforming or overperforming. You also have the ability to add custom fields. Big time allows you to pull a staff type report and include any custom fields. For example, we'll say employee number. So we'll go ahead and create the field, label this field, and select the field type, whether that's alphanumeric, number, currency, percentage, date, Boolean, which is a yes or no option, lookup, which creates a dropdown list, or a link if you need to link to a file repository or somewhere a staffer needs access to. We'll save that field, and always remember to save your changes before moving on. At the bottom, you'll see that you can also delete, merge, or forget a staffer. I typically don't suggest deleting staffers unless they're duplicates, like they came over from QuickBooks. Also, big time won't actually let you delete a staffer if they have any time or expenses logged to them. Merged is probably the most commonly used in the case that there's a duplicate. Merge the one you don't want anymore into the one you'd like to keep. Again, always merge the staffer you don't want into the one you do want to keep. Forgetting staff will maintain historical data, but you won't be able to see them in your staff list view. Now we will take a look at user rights. User rights are one of the most important aspects of big time because it controls the access and permissions for that staffer in big time. You can work with your implementation manager on specific user rights, but I always suggest setting up a test profile with a personal email address to see what big time looks like from that security group's perspective. Management authority provides you a list of departments available to oversee, allowing them to view, edit, or approve time and expenses logged by staffers in those departments, or from a report standpoint, only pulling data for departments that the staffer manages. Staff teams allow you to assign staffers to overarching teams, then on the projects team tab, assign an entire staff team at once instead of adding employees one by one to the project team. Contact info is very self-explanatory, just all the information for that specific staffer. Skills are a premier function that allow you to assign and rank specific staffer qualifications, ensuring the right people are on the right projects. The time and expense tabs provide a historical overview of that staffer's time and expense entries. System admins have visibility into the financials of each staffer and can go here to look into the entries they've logged, as well as edit their entries after they've been submitted, unless you have pending approval set up, and you've rejected an entry for being incorrect, at which point it will be sent back to the staffer to readjust. Same with expenses, it will show any expense reports the staffer has submitted, as well as the status of that expense and the total amount. As for the activities tab, you can think of that as internal communication or sticky notes for your staff to get things done as it relates to specific deliverables on the project. If you don't have an internal communication tool like Slack, activities can go a long way in ensuring that your team is making progress on a specific deliverable. Now activities are not tied to a specific monetary value, they're simply just a running to-do list that you can pull reports on. I can assign an activity at the project level, give it a type, and then associate it with a specific task set up at the project level. That way when I assign it to a specific staffer, if you have your big time notifications and emails turned on, we will notify that staffer that they have an activity assigned to them. You can turn on those emails and notifications by navigating to the person icon in the top right, then my profile, and to the notification settings tab. These are user specific settings, and those notifications will go to this little email icon within the user's site. If your big time site is integrated with Slack, we can also ping them there that they've been assigned to an activity. Lastly, the teams tab is going to give you a high level overview of all the projects this staffer is assigned to, along with their role and whether or not they're a team lead. Teams are more often handled at the project level, but this staff level team tab is helpful to quickly view all their project team assignments in one handy location. Well, that concludes our overall staff set up. By now you should feel comfortable bringing your staffers into your big time site along with adding the pertinent information that's going to help you make informed decisions when it comes to resource planning and management. Thank you.
