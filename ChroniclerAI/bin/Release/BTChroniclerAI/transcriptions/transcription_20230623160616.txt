Hi there everyone. Today in an effort to further customize BigTime to your firm, we will walk through managing your many picklists via field values, how to configure staff permissions with user rights, and briefly highlight the popular applications BigTime integrates with. To begin, we're going to navigate to my company and select field values. Starting with categories, these values populate in the categories picklist when staffers add a new timesheet entry. That way, staffers can indicate how they're spending their time. If you look on the right side of the window, you can add details about your value, as well as link categories to service items you create in QuickBooks. Scroll down and you can see several billing options. Non-billable is associated with time that's not billed to the client like internal meetings. Taxable is if you're using the single invoice rate tax style and subtotaling invoices by category, then checking this box will ensure the category's line item will automatically be marked as taxable on the invoice. If you'd like to archive but not delete a value and the data associated with it, check this inactive box. Remember, you can always reactivate an inactive value. Billing rates will be applied at a project level in the projects rates tab under the basic billing rates drop-down list. Also, if you link a labor code to a service item in QuickBooks, BigTime pulls the code's one default billing rate over from QuickBooks. Expense codes populate in the expense type pick list when staffers create new expense entries. On the right, you can add details, apply a markup to an expense, so you can see we have the taxable and inactive fields. The service fee box denotes a non-reimbursable expense type such as equipment rental or a hosting fee. And lastly, checking the unit of measure box will associate that expense type with a measurement like mileage. You'll also include the cost rate and the sales price. Invoice terms specify to the client what percentage of an invoice is due and when. You also have the option to connect these values to QuickBooks. Let's take a look at the many field values available in your BigTime site. Project types like consulting or advertising classify your projects. Contact types like accounting add more information about your contacts. Team roles identify the different positions on your team. Then when you assign staffers to a project, you can identify their specific role. You can assign a staffer to a department. Then a staffer can be granted management authority over a department and their user rights. When you're assigning staffers to project teams, create a staff team. That way, instead of adding one staffer at a time to a project, you can add an entire team of staffers all at once. Merchant and location are for credit card statement uploads to identify at what business and location the expense was incurred. You can enter your company credit cards so staffers can create credit card expense entries and link the cards with QuickBooks. Client types are to define and classify your clients. Industry type is to denote what industry a skill is specific to. And skill category types act like project types to classify the skills into topic-appropriate categories. Do note these last two are tier-specific as skills matching is a premier feature. Status codes refer to the activity or inactivity of a project, its billing cycle, as well as the status of a staff member. And finally, cost centers are firm-relevant fields you can customize for tracking and reporting purposes. You'll remember the location cost center from our multi-location holiday calendar in the firm settings video previously. Now we'll be walking through how to control the level of permission you want to grant each of your staff through user rights and how to create a new security group. To start, we'll navigate My Company, User Rights. Now by default, you've got the two security groups, System Administrators and Everyone Group. System Administrators will have every single permission turned on so they can see and do everything in big time. As the note below says, none of these can actually be removed from the System Administrator Security Group. So as you can see, the user rights are grouped by functionality throughout the system. If you click into any of the user rights themselves, you can see a brief description of what that permission entails. Now on the other hand, with the Everyone Group, by default, this only has the permission to log time and expenses against any project as well as view public reports within big time. Typically, most clients create a third additional user right group and will do so by clicking this Add New Group button in the bottom right. And we will make a new group for our Project Managers. Perfect. So let's say we want our PMs to be able to add projects, view the Project List menu, add staff and view the Staff List menu, enter and submit time and expenses for their users they manage, give them review and approval authority, give them access to task budget data, and finally give them all access to reporting and make them big time report administrators so they can create and delete reports. We will go ahead and hit Save, and now we can see that we've created a Project Manager Security Group. Now to add someone to that security group, we're going to navigate My Company, Staff List, go to one of these staffers and into the User Rights tab. Now we will select the Project Managers checkbox and uncheck the Everyone checkbox and save those changes. Note you will only want to assign a user to one user right group because say we also checked off the System Administrators checkbox, that group would win out since more permissions are enabled. Now finally, we'll go My Company, Integrations, and when it comes to integrating with other softwares, think of BigTime as a holistic solution for your company. BigTime not only integrates with your favorite tools like QuickBooks, Salesforce, Sage, Lacerte, HubSpot, and Jira, but it also supports single sign-on and offers data imports. Our team is constantly improving these integrations to support the latest available features and functionalities. Now while there is self-guided documentation for integrating with each of these applications on our knowledge base, which you can access by clicking the question mark icon in the upper right and selecting the Knowledge Base link, if applicable, we suggest never enabling an integration without your Implementation Manager being on the call with you. Thank you.
