Now that we're getting comfortable with staff and project setup, in this session we'll cover how you can customize both time and expense sheets to capture any necessary information for invoicing and reporting purposes. To access your time and expense sheets, we're going to navigate to the time expense tab in the navigation bar. First, we're going to select time sheets. The biggest question I typically ask my clients is, what do you currently track on your time sheets, specifically for invoicing and reporting purposes? One thing to note, as a system administrator, you have the ability, on the right drop down, to toggle between each of your staffers' time sheets. When a regular staffer logs in, based on their permissions, if they're only allowed to see their time sheet, they will not have that ability to toggle between different staffers. On the left side, you have the ability to set your view, both at a weekly or daily view. Typically I see the weekly view more often because you're able to see the full week at a glance. However, it is a personal preference for each user. Your staffers will be able to add time by selecting add time sheet row, choosing the appropriate values from the pick lists, entering the hours into the daily tiles, and saving. If time has not been submitted yet, they can always delete the row in the event that they need to edit, or they can edit in the individual tiles themselves, as long as it hasn't been submitted yet. You can also clear any blank rows you don't want showing up on the time sheet, as well as shifting forwards and backwards in time. We also have a print icon in the event you'd like to print a PDF version of that time. Then on the right side, we have this gear icon, allowing you to customize your time sheet even further. On the left side, we have these columns denoting what you'd like the staffer to track to, and on the right side, we have additional settings. Choose when your time sheets begin using this first weekday pick list. Typically, I see Sunday or Monday, but it is company preference. You can also select the submission period. One thing to note is that when choosing bi-weekly, you can modify the bi-weekly start dates. We also give the ability to control rounding for time. Entry rounding will affect the staffers' input hours or the time the staffer sees on the time sheet, and billable entry rounding will affect the billable hours for that time entry, allowing you to bill your client at a different rounded amount compared to staff input hours. You can select your time formatting between decimals and minutes. You can also check this box to lock the time sheet period if you don't want staffers to be able to submit time after a certain period. The end of the submission period is determined by the submission period above, but if you'd like to lock your time sheet submission period, say by month or quarter instead of submission period, you can then set that here. You'll also see the grace period and the lock time entry date. The grace period gives your staff a few extra days to submit time and after the period ends. The lock date will automatically populate based on your grace period. Under the detail fields, you can require staffers to add certain details to their time sheets. These columns are some examples of standard details like tracking time to the project category task as well as QuickBooks class. However, I can also add additional detail fields. For example, if you need more detail about the work being done, you can require notes for every time submission. You can also enter if there is no charge, so if that time is non-billable like admin work or sick time. And you can also include a pay item if you're using payroll in QuickBooks. Also similar to the project and staff setup, you have the ability to add five custom fields in the case there's something you want to track against that isn't readily available. On my previous screen, there was a footer that showed over under capacity after the daily totals. Remember, capacity comes from the staff profile, so we can show you if someone is over or under worked based on their capacity as well as the billable percentage of their capacity. If there's any columns you don't want, click into the columns blank space. So then you can click the minus button. This will remove the column. By clicking into the blank space, you can also specify if a value is required. Big Time will notify the staffer of any required info is missing by highlighting that field after a submission attempt. I also want to point out these two extra fields in the project column. The project dropdown list format changes when the project pick list looks like on the timesheet, and the project display name style controls the naming convention of your projects in your project list found under the My Company tab. Once you feel confident in your timesheet setup, you can click the update timesheet format, and this will save any changes you've made to the timesheet. When your staffer is ready to start tracking time, they can select the add timesheet row, then select the project category, and the task. Remember, if there's a particular task assigned to a specific staffer, only that staffer will see the task. If the task assignment is blank, the staffer will see all tasks in the dropdown. Once the task is selected, then we can enter the hours as well as the notes, but here it is good to see what it looks like when you don't fill something out that's required. So I'll put that in. Then do note if I click the no charge, you'll see those hours at the bottom, those billable hours change as well. And then I'm going to go ahead and click save. Now there are five hours of unsubmitted time in this period. If there are any unsubmitted hours in previous periods, that'll also reflect below. Simply logging time and saving does not actually submit the time. You need to click submit hours. As long as staffers haven't submitted time, staff can edit the entries. However, once you submit hours, your timesheet will be refreshed and the lock icon appears. As a staffer, I cannot edit Monday's time entry because now it is locked, but you can always add hours for days that aren't currently locked. As well as if you are a system admin and the time's locked and needs editing. If you have pending approvals set up under my company pending approvals, then you can reject the time so the staffer will update it based on the rejection notes. Otherwise you can go to their staff profile and time tab to edit the specific entry that needs revisions. Any time that was submitted will go directly to our WIP tile and the invoicing overview page. And remember from our project session, you can have time calculated by staff rate, category rate, or a flat rate if we're tracking against time and materials. So do keep in mind the rate structure of your projects. That's all for customization of your timesheet. Now I want to turn your attention to expenses. Expenses operate the same way as your timesheet. However, there are a few additional details to note. Again, as a system admin on the right side, you'll be able to toggle between staffers expense sheets. And then on the left, by clicking add new expense, this will take you to a window where your staffers can enter those expenses. First let's take a look at the customization via the same gear icon from the timesheet. From here you can select your entry format, whether that is the default amount entries or the amount plus tax rate. Selecting the amount plus tax rate, as we will see, now includes a drop down where you can select the tax rate when entering the expense amount. But for today's purposes, we are just going to go with the default entry format. You'll also see the expense entry fields. Similar to the timesheet, you can include and require specific fields. You can also include a field in your system, but hide in your user's data entry page to minimize errors. These admin only fields will only appear on forms used to edit expenses once they're submitted. Right now I have staffers tracking towards the task, the QuickBooks class, notes, whether the expense is non-billable, and whether or not it was paid by the company. You can have a staffer specify that this will be a non-reimbursable expense because they utilized a corporate card. You can also select the merchant name and location, as well as add custom fields. For today, I will uncheck class and save my settings. Now when we go to add a new expense, we will choose an expense type, select the date, and select the project and the amount. Staffers can also attach a receipt should they have any documents related to that expense, and then you can mark an expense as either non-billable, meaning that expense won't be charged to the client, or non-reimbursable if the staffer specified a credit card used for the expense. This just means we aren't going to reimburse that staffer because a credit card was already utilized. Perfect. Once I click save, on the left-hand side, BigTime will actually tally up all the expenses the staffer has submitted and create an expense report. You can add any additional expenses, and just like the timesheet, just entering expenses does not mean they've been submitted, so any unsubmitted expenses can still be revised. Once you click submit expenses, you can then rename the expense report, and then select the expenses if you'd like to include just a few if there are multiple. Then when I submit, based on your approval settings, the expense will be sent to the approvers, or if there are no pending approvals set up, any expenses that are billable, just like time, will go to your WIP tile in Invoicing Overview. Your staff will then be able to view their expense report history, and any submitted expense reports will reflect as submitted, as well as show any approval statuses. You also have the ability to either manually enter credit card charges, via this dropdown, add charge, or upload a credit card statement, which is an efficient way to have BigTime convert those transactions into credit card expenses. I also want to highlight vendor expenses. If you're utilizing vendors in QuickBooks and you need to generate a vendor expense or vendor bill, as opposed to a reimbursable expense you push to QuickBooks that just creates a check, if I select from this dropdown, add vendor expense, it's exactly like entering a reimbursable expense, only with the new inclusion of the vendor pick list, as well as the reference number. But the process of submitting a vendor expense will be the exact same as a reimbursable expense, however now we're just denoting the vendor in order to create a vendor bill that you can then post from your QuickBooks post expenses tab. Note the landing page will be the reimbursable expenses, and your vendor expenses will be accessed via this link at the bottom of the screen. As you can see, this is also where you would navigate in order to post these regular expenses to QuickBooks, and the post timesheets tab is exactly that, how you would post that time to QuickBooks as well. The create vendor bills tab is applicable for those staffers you've set up in their staff profile to post time as bill, as well as linking them to a vendor. You'll also need this feature activated via my company, my company active features to see this tab in the QuickBooks navigation options. That's all for our session today on time and expense customization, and you should now feel comfortable getting your site configured for staff to start logging time and expenses. Thank you.
