Hi there, everyone. In today's session, we will create an invoice using our item-based invoice calculator. Item-based billing is used for invoicing different task fee types on a single invoice. You can bill each task as time and materials, milestone, percent complete, retainer, or non-billable line items. This saves you time by creating a single invoice instead of multiple invoices with all your various task fee types. Today we'll walk through activating the item-based calculator, applying different fee types to your tasks, and creating an item-based billing invoice. First, let's activate the item-based billing calculator. Click Invoicing and Configure from your navigation bar. Then click Calculators, find the item-based billing calculator, and click the Off toggle to then turn it on and activate it. Finally, we'll save our change. Now let's create some tasks with different fee types. First we'll navigate to the project you're billing for in the project list. Then to that project's task editor. Add tasks to your task editor if none currently exist. Once they've been added, click on the three dots next to the task name and select Edit Task. Next we'll click on the Accounting tab. In the bottom Fee Type dropdown is where you'll choose how these fees for this task are invoiced. Click the dropdown list to populate all possible fee type options. Do note, retainer fees bill the same amount for each invoice. So each time you create an invoice with retainer fees using the item-based calculator, the invoice will include a line item with the same amount regardless of hours logged to this task. Going back to the editor, we're going to leave QA and Analysis tasks as Time and Materials tasks. Now the Coding task, since we have a budget, we're actually going to change that one to Percent Complete. So the three dots, Edit Task, already on the Accounting tab, in the Fee Type dropdown, we will select Percent Complete Billing and save our changes. And Marketing is actually signed to a monthly contract, so we'll make that a retainer fee type. So the three dots, Edit Task, we will select Retainer Billing and input the amount of that retainer to be included on each item-based invoice. Save our changes. Overall, don't forget to save your work. And now that we've done that, we'll create an invoice with those different task fee types. First, we'll navigate to Invoicing Overview page. Click into the Work in Progress tile. Find the project that you're billing for and select the blue hyperlink dollar amount for the project that you're billing for. And choose the item-based billing invoice option from the Create Invoice dropdown. Here on the last step of the Invoicing Wizard, you can see the different tasks from the project. We've got QA, Analysis, those all have WIP log to them, and their expenses are actually broken out as different line items due to this checkbox on the left. I'll actually uncheck that because the expenses included are not pass-through expenses, and I do not want them to contribute toward the total of the invoice. Unchecking will bring the invoice back to just task-level line items. Do note that the expenses have been cleared from the WIP and attached to this invoice, they just no longer count toward the invoice's total. Then we see the marketing retainer line item for that $2,500. And finally, for the coding task, because it is a percent complete task fee type, we will check the box to include it on this invoice, then input the percentage of the task that we're billing out. We'll say we're billing 25% of this budget. Once you're done entering the proper information, go ahead and finalize this invoice. And you've now created an invoice utilizing the item-based calculator. Just like the fixed fee calculator, if you have a percent complete task fee type on your invoice, you might want to include budget status data. You can do that by navigating to the desired PDF style, going invoicing, configure, PDF styles, find your designated style, click the edit button, scroll down to the third section and click on that budget status tab. Here you can select to include budget status details. This will give you an array of budget detail options to include on the invoice when utilizing this PDF style. I'll select to include the overall budget, the fee budget, any prior billings, as well as my remaining budget. And also, specifically for item-based billing, you can check this determine invoice data by task fee type to populate budget data grouped by task fee type. I will check that, save my changes, save them again, navigate to the preview option, select the desired PDF style. And here you can see the budgetary information grouped by task fee type. That completes today's session and you should now feel comfortable utilizing item-based billing to invoice different task fee types on a single invoice. Thank you.
