The task type report isn't just limited to budget data, it can also be useful to view invoicing information as well. I'll choose that task type report again. And to start I will add the client name, project name, task name, scroll down a little bit and add my fee estimate. Also remember, if you're looking for a specific column, type a keyword into this search box to narrow down your column options. I want to see invoice related data. I want to see to date information like the total billable fees and expenses as well as the total amount invoice. One thing to keep in mind with this invoice information is you do want to make sure that you are subtotaling invoices by task. That is, if you're using a time and materials type invoice, in order for this task type report data to be accurate, you want to be sure those invoices are subtotaled by task. Of course, with fixed fee and item based billing, those are automatically subtotaled by task. You can also see margin data for each individual task. The total activity to date section will include fees and expenses, but if you'd rather see that separate, like total fees invoiced, you choose those specific fields under the appropriate sections. Same for expenses. If I delete the invoice keyword, you can also see budget status data based on those invoices, like what I've estimated for my budgets and what's left of my budgets, a la the charges remaining column. Again, as long as those invoices are being subtotaled by task, you'll be able to see accurate information. Now that I've added all the columns I want, I will go to options, customize grouping, group this report by client, and add a group in subtotal. It's also common to group by project as well for an additional level of organization, so I'll do exactly that. That way I can see the client and the project data all in one. Update my report, go ahead and publish it. I will name it Invoice Budget Data by Task. Publish. Now I can see the client and each of the individual projects with their subtotal task values. Then, if I scroll down a bit more, you can see for each client the overall subtotal project numbers as well. Now I'll go back to the report center. Now financial information isn't just specific to project or task type reports. You can also see data for each of your invoices with an invoice list type report. This first section of columns includes general invoice details, so first I'll add the project name and the invoice number. Scroll down a little bit, and I will also add the total charges on the invoice. In this next section, we can see if an invoice has been paid along with any accompanying payment data like the payment amount or the last payments type. Keep scrolling and you can also see any time charges that have been added to that particular invoice as well as their costs. Same if you're invoicing expenses as well. The invoice reports will also allow you to see your profitability, which is calculated by the total fee charges minus the total input time costs. Again, I always like to point out that you can use these drill down links to open up directly to a specific space. In this particular case, I'm going to select to open the individual invoice. Save that. Then I'll navigate to my options, customize grouping, and I'll group this report by invoice number. That way, the invoice data is in sequential order when I'm running the report. Update it, create it, give it a name, and then publish the report. Now I can see all my invoices in order. When I click on an invoice number, it will open directly to that invoice to see any additional details or make any changes. You should now feel comfortable utilizing task type and invoice list type reports to gain insight into your invoiced budget data at the task level along with payment info and profitability at an invoice level. Thank you.
