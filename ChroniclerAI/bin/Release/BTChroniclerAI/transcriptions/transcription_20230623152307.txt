As mentioned in the previous video, when you click on the report section on your top navigation bar within BigTime and select the report center option, the report page will appear and you can scroll down to the wallet payment report section here. You'll notice that there's three available reports for you. Deposits, fee statements, and fee statement detail. If you select the deposit report, this report will provide you with a comprehensive list of all deposits made into your bank account, specifying the deposit number, the client, the transaction ID, the payment method, whether it's a bank, which is ACH, or credit card, but most notably the deposit batch data. As you can see on this date, this many payments were batched together and comprised the deposit that was made into your bank account. In addition, the fee statement report will give you a monthly breakdown on the total volume of invoice payments made, so for July 7th, 2020, eight invoice payments, eight transactions were made across a total volume of 1,000 and how much was taken out for transaction fees. The third report is the fee statement detail report, which gives you further detail on the amount taken out for transaction fees on a per transaction basis. So on November 17th, 2020, or let's actually take October 8th, 2020, $17.11 were taken out for transaction fees. The deposit amount was $572.89 after those fees were taken out and actually deposited into your account, and the total before those fees were taken out were $590. These three reports serve as a great reference tool for you to see what payments were deposited on a specific date, as well as your fee breakdown on a monthly and per transaction basis. This concludes the big time wallet tutorial demonstration video.
