As mentioned before, the next task report type we're going to explore is the Task by Assigned Staff member. We will walk through this report type by creating a custom Task Budget by Assigned Staff report. This report type is different from the regular task type because this will show task data in a staff-centric list. So say you're scheduling out your projects and you want to see what each staffer is assigned to, this task by the assigned staff member report is going to allow you to see that information more efficiently. You'll see a lot of the same fields are going to be included in this column selection list as the regular task type report. So first I'll add the project name, the task name, the start and due date of those tasks, and then I will actually add the hours estimate. Because this is a task report by assigned staffer, this field will reflect a specific staff member's share of the overall task budget. Like if task A has a budget of 20 hours and has two staff assigned, then the budget per staff member is 10 hours. Then you can go ahead and add their staff name. The other thing with the report type is you can also add the user assignment. So I can see who else is assigned to that particular task other than the individual staffer I'm looking at. If you've assigned a task to multiple staffers, then that item will appear once for each assigned user in the dataset. And then to easily see this data, I will group it by staffer. Some customers also like to further group it by project as well. Go ahead and update that and publish my report. So you can see these first few tasks are unassigned. That's why there's no grouping label. But we will scroll towards the bottom, and because I have this grouped by staffer, you'll start to see some name labels pop up to show the group of tasks that they're assigned to, like Aaron Anderson. You can see the project and task that they're assigned to. I can also see that there are other staffers also assigned to that particular task. So I can see when this task is also set to start, when it is actually due, and what the hourly estimates are. These reports can also be shared with those staffers as well, like if you're sharing to the public reports or my report sections. A helpful filter to utilize if you intend on sharing this report is by adding the my task yes no column. This will return a yes or no if that task is assigned to the user that's running the report. You could then open up the filtering and add a new one that goes mine equals yes. That means whoever's actually viewing the report, it's only going to show tasks that are assigned to them. That filter is really helpful for sharing a single report with everyone as opposed to creating a separate report for each individual staffer. I'll publish this once more. And now you can see that because I added that filter, the only tasks in this report are the ones that I'm assigned to. You could also go back to the customization of the report and hide this my task column because now the report only shows your tasks, making the viewing of that column kind of irrelevant. And that is our custom task budget by assigned staff report. Thank you.
