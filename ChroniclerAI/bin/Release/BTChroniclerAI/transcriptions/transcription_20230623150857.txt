Hi, everybody, and welcome to our quick overview of big time software for and our integration with Sage intact. My name is Ben Mascow and I am our director of solutions consulting over here. So what I'm what I'm going to excuse me what I'm here to do today is really walk us through that overall integration with Sage intact. Tell us a little bit more about why a lot of professional service firms choose to work with us and where all that goes. And then we'll take a quick look at a quick customer testimonial today as well. So we're talking to you today because you're struggling to run your business and you come up against a lot of problems with managing time, budgets, juggling priorities, getting through a lot of those difficulties that come with running a day to day operations within a professional service firm. And Sage is a fantastic general ledger. But maybe we just need a little bit more visibility into projects, people, resource allocation, and where all that goes. You know, so this might be a little bit about how your firm looks today. You know, accounting is disconnected from resource management, analytics and reporting live in a silo, maybe in a spreadsheet or two, if you're a lot of businesses I work with project management's bespoke and different by each project manager and time and expense lives off on its own land. This can make it super challenging to run a PS organization and it's a big part of the reason that people start coming to big time. So what you'll see when you come to big time is that you're going to see a little bit here's some results of a benchmark report that we actually ran last year. And then so what we saw was like, here's some huge and prep and like improvements that people saw 91% of their invoices are paid on time for customers using big time wallet, which is our payment processing platform. 93% of their projects were delivered on or within budget, and their productivity rose 52%. So 92% of respondents also said that they're making more proactive business decisions, they're going in there, they're being able to see things before they happen, instead of being having to react after the fact. A lot of times that I like to say is that we're in the business of avoiding awkward conversations, you're going over budget, and you're struggling with that a lot of those things can be pretty awkward. You know, so really, what the biggest benefits that some of our folks are seeing out of this is the benefits of a joint solution or the ability to reduce admin time and administration, you're getting invoices out the door faster. And you're making more data driven decisions on not just who should be working on the projects, but how should I price these projects? As we get into this year, and a little bit more on certain financial times, I think it's important for everybody to understand who's working on your projects, how profitable are you and where does that information go? Next let's get into a quick high level overview of our integration with stage and then we'll actually step into platform and deliver a demonstration on it. So if you look here, by directionally between stage, we're going to be able to sync staff, clients, projects, payments, invoices. And then in, we'll be able to also post over expenses, time sheets, and a lot of other information as well. Back into big time, we're also going to pull your list of departments, locations, accounts, classes, service items. So really to make sure that big time isn't interfering with the work that you've done to set up your stage site. So our goal is always to have you be able to put the relevant project level information in big time, have it map and match to the correct entities, accounts, and locations that you have set up, and simplify time for your project staff as you get in there. Let's actually take a quick look now at getting into a demonstration of big time. So I'm going to come over here to big time. This big time instance is connected to this stage intact instance here. So what we'll do is we'll take a quick look at how this information flows. I'm going to walk up to this my company menu and come to our project list. Here I'm going to get a list of all of my in-flight customers and jobs. The first time you connect big time to intact, you're actually going to pull that entire list in as well. Really helps us be one of the fastest to implement solutions in the marketplace is being able to get all that information just with the click of a button. But in this case here, I'm just going to hit add a project. And we'll put this under my cleverly named Acme Corporation. And this can be my Sage webinar project. And then I can hit add. If you have standard lists of deliverables, templates, things like that, we can templatize it and really speed up that product and resume that project kickoff process. But in this case here, I'm just going to hit add. That creates a new project in big time. It's just flagging for me here that hey, this project exists in big time, but it doesn't intact exist in intact yet. So if I say yes, I want to export this project out to intact, it's going to take that information and it's going to push it out to intact based on the customer and job settings. These department and location fields, these are tied through to your Sage departments and locations. So I can say what is my location? Where does that go? Where should those transactions go within my Sage general ledger? Can I now come up here to my tasks? On these tasks, I can come in and I can say like, right, what is my, you know, phase one of this project? What's my budget for it? How is it being invoiced? And even down to the line item within Sage, I can come in here and I can say, you know, this should be connected to my, oh, maybe my design. And then it's all part of this service line one here. So now I have a project, a budget, and everything pushed over to intact appropriately. Let's capture some time and create an invoice off that. So if I come to my time and expense, I go to my time sheets. This is what end users see when they actually log into the platform, they get a list of all of the customers and jobs that they've been working on week over week. A lot of feedback I get is that we want to be easiest used, easiest to use timesheet places in the marketplace. And really be pretty simple. I'm going to add timesheet row. We're going to search for that Sage webinar project that I just made. And I'm gonna select that same task. If you're posting timesheets over to Sage, these can all be tied through to these all of these items here, these can be tied through to like Sage time types, you can actually like get these in here. But this is a lot of times people will use this as well just a way to further subdivide that. But if I'm going to come in here, I'm going to record eight hours today. What a day. It saves. And we got another few hours tomorrow. I go to save that. It's now be able to submit those hours and actually go through and get paid on those. If you have a timesheet of review and approval process, that's where this would go would be post this free invoicing. In this case here, I have timesheet approvals turned off in this site. But I'm going to come up over to invoicing. We're going to go to our overview. This is where I'm going to see a gathering of all of my work in process. So here's all of the time and expenses that are on build on my projects. Any drafted invoices not yet posted over to Sage. And then any current and past due AR aging. Payments do sync bidirectionally between big time and Sage as I mentioned earlier. So this allows you to keep project managers, anybody who's helping with collections out of Sage if you don't want them in there, but still give them visibility they need to do their job on a day to day basis. When I come in here, I can see all of my time. So you can see I've got 16 hours, $4,400 of the time. I can do this in bulk. But today I'm just going to work on a single invoice. So we're going to say create a time and materials invoice. That's going to bring me right here. And we can subtotal it. Let's subtotal it by that task. So you can see that 16 hours at $2.75 an hour. I hit finalize. That takes me over here to here. In my preview tab, I can configure how I want this to look to clients. What do I want them to see? Should they see all of the time and everything dedicated to it? Or should they maybe just get something a little bit more, you know, a little bit more simple and not have all that time detail? We can also do things like include a budget status, all of that information on the invoice. When I go to post this invoice to Sage, you can see that it's read my design level phase here. You know, I can say this is net 30. This is part of my marketing department and this belongs to that Canada location. Or I can let it read from those project level settings. But then when I hit post to Sage, that invoice is now exists in Sage. If I come back over here, you can see that here is my most recent invoices that I've created. I'm going to go ahead and click on the screen because I'm in my Sage order entry module. Here is that same invoice transaction that just came over. So I'm going to view that. It's $4,400. So you can see that invoice just came over here. I'm going to go ahead and mark that paid. And then hit pay. So now I've got my invoice mark paid in Sage. That payment will be reflected bidirectionally in big time. And then I'm also going to be able to get that accurate information across both systems about revenue. That is a quick overview of our Sage intact integration. What I'm going to do now is jump back into the deck and let's actually go through a few of those client stories. Coming back in here, I want to tell you a little bit about one of our clients, Aegis Project Controls. They're a consulting company for construction. They've got about 140, 150-ish employees. When they came to big time, I worked directly with their CFO Kyle on this. They're operating in three separate systems. They were thinking they needed an ERP. What they decided on because they already had Sage intact in place, they had intact in place. They looked through the marketplace to see if something could help them. It was really that integration on the class, the item level, getting information to the right entity without having to do a ton of manual legwork on them is what brought them over here to big time. Kyle McDonald, he has been great to work with as the CFO over there. Really what he brought to the table when we asked him, I'm kind of like talking a little bit about this. They were running within three different software platforms. They were doing things that now Sage and big time two together in complete silos, and they wanted to get everything together. Basically what they found was that they're in a typical month, their finance team has an extra week and a half of work now because we took their close process from five to seven or more days down to a three to five day process. They've been able to automate a lot of this out. If these are problems you're struggling with, if this is something that you want help with, please reach out. Here is the best contact information for our sales team, sales at big time.net. That is our main frontline there as well. Feel free to reach out. We'd be happy to help. Look forward to working with everybody.
