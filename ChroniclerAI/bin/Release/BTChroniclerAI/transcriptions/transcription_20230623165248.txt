Hi there, everyone. During this session, we are going to walk through the utilization of the retainer invoice calculator from turning on the calculator to filling out the custom field and finally creating the invoice. The retainer invoice calculator allows you to bill a client a fixed amount on a recurring basis regardless of the time charges towards the project. It charges the amount entered into the retainer custom field on the project detail screen. The custom field will be created once the invoice calculator is imported and activated in your big time site. Time is included on the invoice but won't be applied to the invoice total. If there are any expenses, they would be billed as separate line items in addition to the retainer. First, we'll need to enable the retainer calculator within the invoicing configure sub tab. We will click on the calculators tab and if you don't automatically see the retainer calculator, click on the gallery of specialized calculators at the bottom of the window. You should now see retainer and can click import to activate it within your site. You will now see it active in your list of calculators. Now we will actually navigate to the project that we will be billing fixed retainer for. Once you navigate to the project, click on the details tab and scroll to the bottom. Here you will see a newly created custom field called retainer. Here you'll input the fixed amount you will be charging on each invoice. I'll put in 5,000. Remember that time entries can be included on the invoice, effectively clearing those time entries from the WIP, but they will not contribute to the invoices total. Now expenses, if included, will be charged separately and added to the invoices total. We are now ready to start the invoicing process. We'll navigate back to the invoicing overview page and you can either click into the WIP tile to select the project there or click the create invoice button. I'll click into the WIP tile and select the project amount for the project that I am billing for. Then I will click the create invoice drop down and select create retainer invoice. Here you can see there are no fees included from the time entries, only the retainer amount denoted at the project level. The expenses have been included as their own line item and are added to the total. And here on the left you can see the retainer amount being charged. This is pulled directly from that custom field at the project level. And do note that changing the retainer here in the upper left of the invoice wizard does change the retainer at the project level as well and will apply that new amount onto any new retainer invoices created for this project. Also note that the retainer line item is locked and the amount can only be altered by changing the custom field, but you will be able to change the name of the line item to whatever you desire once you finalize the invoice. Once everything is all set, we can then click finalize. And you've now created a retainer invoice to send to your client. You should now feel comfortable utilizing the retainer invoice calculator to bill a client a fixed amount on a recurring basis. Thank you.
