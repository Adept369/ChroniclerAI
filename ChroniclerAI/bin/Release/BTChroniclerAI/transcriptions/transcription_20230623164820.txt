Hi there everyone. The last piece of the site configuration puzzle is reporting. Today we're going to cover the basics of the report center, some integral reporting user rights, take a look at report types, how to create a custom report, and settings like grouping, filtering, and permissions. First we'll select reports from the navigation bar, and under this tab you'll see the report center, public reports where you can publish reports for the everyone user to see, as well as my reports, a folder for your shared reports. First I'll talk through the report center. There's going to be a navigation bar with five tiles. You can click on each tile to see the pre-built reports that are associated with each functionality of BigTime. For time tracking we have some timesheet detail and timesheet summary reports. The invoicing tile will show you an AR aging detail report, invoice summary list, or unbilled time and expense details or summaries. We also have payroll related reports. Useful if you're running payroll with a third party vendor and you need to input those timesheets by the billable hours by a staff member. You can then export that data via a report from your report center. Our task lists tile, you can see things like allocations if you're premier level or your standard task list you have set up at the project level. These have all been pre-built reports that come default with your BigTime site and are incapable of being deleted. But now if you click the magnifying glass tile, it gives you the ability to create your own report. You can also get a quick summary of each type of report by clicking on them and seeing the description at the bottom here. There are 16 overall report types. I do want to quickly highlight our user rights because there are a few that pertain directly to report visibility and creation. As a system admin, you can see every report generated, however, if I go to my company, user rights, into a group and drill down the reporting section, there are a few different permissions. The first being the access public reports. Typically a system admin and an everyone user would both be able to access that public report center. This would include reports that are designed for each staff member to see. We have the all access to reports. This is something geared towards sometimes a C-level or leadership type role because there's cost and billing info associated with it, unless you turn off the permission that reveals any billing or cost rate information. Then we have our BigTime report administrator. This allows you to create and customize reports in the report center. And finally, you can also enable or disable the ability to create and edit report groups, which allows that user to create user groups for the purpose of sharing specific reports. Back to the report center, I want to discuss the different report types. If I were to create a report from scratch by clicking on the magnifying glass, then create your report. It's going to ask you to select a report type based on the data you'd like to populate. For example, if I were to create a staff list type report and select next, you will know right away what type of report this is because the column selection list will populate that name at the top right here. Now, if I went back to the report center and I created a project list report, you'll then see the name reflected at the top of this menu right here. You can now include project related information like the project name, the production status, the billing status. And as I scroll down, we have a ton of different data fields you can include. You can also hover over the label selection to see what that field entails, especially useful if the column involves calculations like for profitability or realization. I do like to highlight the difference between some of these prebuilt system reports like the timesheet detail report and the timesheet summary reports. Now, the timesheet detail is going to pull in all entries submitted by your staffers, whereas the timesheet summary report will pull in the total hourly data submitted by your staffers. If I go into the timesheet detail report, I have the ability to see the project, staff member, category that was tracked on the timesheet, the date the time was tracked, the input hours and whether or not those hours were billable, as well as any associated notes. You'll notice this report is set up by date range, but if I click into edit report settings, I can change the dates, reflecting the range you'd like to populate data for. We'll also discuss sharing a copy of this report in a moment. On the right, you can click the question mark as seen on the project and staff lists that gives a detailed description of the currently displayed columns. The magnifying glass allows you to search specific fields in the report, and then your results will be highlighted in blue. You can also set live filters in the event that you need to hone in on something specific for each column. I can also export the report as a PDF, XLS sheet or Word document if any changes or calculations are required outside of big time. You also have the ability to customize. You can either customize a system default report by selecting customize or create a copy. Selecting customize on any pre-built system report will automatically create a copy, as you do not have the ability to edit or delete those default system reports. Creating a copy will also give you a foundation to build off of when creating a custom report. You can then click into a blank field and click the plus button then to add new data. For example, I'll add submission status to determine whether the staffer has submitted time or if it is still lingering in the staffer's timesheets unsubmitted. You can also click the minus button to remove the column from the report. You can also add in drill down links. These links give you the ability to see information pulled in from other areas of big time without ever leaving the report. For example, if I click into input hours, open the drill down link list, then select open time entry detail, in the event I need to make any changes to that time entry, then it'll update in real time. You also have the ability to hide columns, like if there's a report you're building and it's getting too big or you only need that column to create a filter against, you can hide the column, but the data is still technically present on the back end of the report. On the upper left, I can also edit my report settings. I can choose to populate everything when opening the report, or I can choose to select a specific project, which is important if you're adding any reports to the financials tab of a project. I mentioned on the project course that if I selected a project and navigate to the financials tab, I can come in and add a report view from the report center, as long as the report chosen is set to select a specific project. I can also select a specific client when opening this report. I can tell big time what the report viewer should see, whether that's everything based on their permissions, only show data for projects they're staffed on, like if they're on a staff team, only show data for staffers they manage, like if they manage a department, or do I want to only show data for projects they're a team lead on. I can select the date filtering style, as well as tell big time what I want the default date range to reflect as whenever I open this report. I can also choose to filter reports, results by selected staffer. I will then update my report. On the right, I have the ability to further organize my report by clicking options. For customized grouping, you have the ability to set up multi-level grouping. At a maximum, you can set up to three grouping levels. For example, I'll group by project and add a group subtotal, and I'll also group by staff member and add a group subtotal as well. You can also select to not hide any columns that I'm subtotaling, and if you're printing this report, you can choose page break between values so each page will be broken up by the first level of grouping, in this case, by project. And finally, rounding. You can choose to round the subtotal values at the overall subtotal level, or each line item first before adding the totals. I will then select to update this report, and then take a look at options, customize filtering. Here, I can tell BigTime what information I'd like to pull. For example, I can say staff member equals a specific staff member. Then if I update that report and create it, I can name the report and also tell BigTime under what heading or section I should publish this report to. I can also include a description so you have intel on what this report means, especially if you're making a copy, and I can update the billing and cost rates each time the report is run. Once I publish this report, you'll notice based on my filtering, it's only showing my specific time because that's what I filtered the report to include. You'll also see it's grouped by staff member as well as project. You can take it one step further by navigating customize, edit this report, options, customize filtering, and I can add in another filter that says submitted equals yes, meaning that I only want to show time entries that have been submitted by Brian and not just entered. I'll go ahead and republish the report. It won't publish another copy. It'll just implement the changes to this report. You will notice that the report has shrunk because there is still time that I have not yet submitted, and the overall total will always be at the bottom here. If I go back to customize, edit this report, and then select options, I can also set report permissions. This is basically restricting report access by unchecking these security groups. There might be an important report that you'd only like admins to have access to, so you'd only leave the system admin box checked. This also impacts those what should the report viewer see settings we took a look at a few minutes ago. Basically, think of the type of data each security group is designated to see before you share the report. I'll go ahead and publish this report. Now if we click the edit report settings on a published report, once you've established your report permissions to those user groups, you can share a copy of the report. When you're ready to share a report with a particular group, you can select that group from the dropdown. You can also edit the values to create or edit those report groups consisting of your designated security groups. If you have specific groups already set up, then each time you share this report and select run report, it becomes a memorized report within the my reports sub tab. Within that tab, you will see the reports shared to the groups that you are a part of. I'm going to go back to the report center, and then when I scroll down, you'll see the different headings that reports can be published under based on the content of the report. Now I want to walk through creating your own report. I'll click the magnifying glass and then create your report. Then I'll select staff list. And I want to know how much time has not been submitted yet for staff. So first I will go ahead and choose name first last. I'll type in here in the search bar that I'm looking for input hours. I'll click the total input hours. And then I will go ahead and also search for unsubmitted time. Perfect. Then I will go to options, customize grouping. Then I'll group by staff or name, add a group subtotal, and include a page break between those name values. Perfect. I'll go ahead and update that report. And then I will select options, customize filtering. A very handy tip here when creating reports, including this filter of name equals SID and the value is at UID, all capitals. This will force the report to only populate information for the staffer that is viewing the report. Very helpful when staffers want to check how much time they have logged in a given period. I'll go ahead and update this report. And in case you ever forget, this filter will always live in this timesheet detail report under the public reports heading in your report center. It is a system report that is incapable of being deleted or altered. You'll just have to go ahead on the back end and customize this specific report into the customized filtering, and you'll see that filter right here for you. Go back to the report that we were making. If I am a system admin, I don't need this. I will go ahead and get rid of that filter. Then I will create the report and name it unsubmitted time. Go ahead and publish this. Now that I've published it, you will see the input time for each of these staffers as well as the time that has been unsubmitted for those staffers in this date range as well. To delete a report, go ahead and click this trash icon. Yes. And you can only delete customized reports, none of the prebuilt system reports. Now while we will be rolling out more customization for the report center soon, if you're going to have multiple parties creating reports, best practice is to include initials or a specific signifier in the report names to differentiate between possible duplicates. Reporting configuration works best when there's applicable data in your site and is why we choose to cover reporting last. I do suggest digging into the report center and creating your own test reports as a way to get familiar with the different capabilities and types of reports. As always, we very much appreciate your time and engagement, and we look forward to your continued success with BigTime. Thank you. Thank you.
