Everyone here? Great. Well, thanks everyone for joining. I know this was a hot request for dashboard training. So basically what we're going to go through today is just like a little bit of a presentation around the different big-time intelligence solutions that we offer, especially as we continue to grow, as we move towards BI, there's going to be another service in place to be able to sell. We'll talk through just like why dashboards as a whole, just the value, specific personas that dashboards can be related to, and then the second part of this will be just diving in to actually the dashboard feature, which everybody has access to in their big-time account, and really taking the time to utilize this as an interactive session. I know Tasia set Hans and I questions that we'll definitely give attention to as well, but the goal of this training is for you guys to come away feeling comfortable being able to talk about dashboards to your customers and start having those conversations to drum up interest, especially while we have data warehouse, BI is coming out, we want all of you to feel comfortable knowing the differences and when to pitch each one. Are there any questions before we dive in? Great. So I just mentioned understanding the difference between our big-time intelligence solutions, effectively being able to position dashboards to our customers, although it's not available globally yet, we can still start to take like those pre-orders to drum up that engagement and re-engage with them come March, and then just starting that conversation earlier than later and getting an understanding of like what they're currently utilizing to visualize data. Are they utilizing something outside of big-time like Looker or Tableau, or do they have their own BI tool as a way to also start those conversations on how big-time data visualization can help. Great. Awesome. Thank you, Marty. So I'm going to kind of cover the three layers of kind of data management that we have at big-time. So I'm going to kind of dive into all three of them. Please feel free to ask questions once I've kind of explained them through, if there's any differences that are still unclear or maybe, you know, I don't know. So we'll see what questions pop up. So the first one is obviously our big-time dashboards, which is why we're here. So we'll start right there. So obviously we've all seen them. They're dashboards built right into big-time, really just giving way to data visualizations. Like we've all, you know, seen a report in big-time. Just imagine seeing that in a pie format, a bar format, a line format. Imagine going to Excel and literally exporting your reports actually and looking at them in Excel. I would bet that some of your customers, everyone has at least a few customers doing that to visualize their data, just doing it in Excel, the manual way. So that's really what we're accomplishing. We're taking those reports and we are turning those into charts so that our customers can view their big-time data straight on their dashboards. They don't need to leave big-time and it's really only big-time data. So that is available March 23rd. Big-time data warehouse. So this is kind of going to segue into Power BI. I just want everyone to kind of understand what like the warehouse and Power BI is so that we're able to tell the differences and kind of pitch the appropriate one to our customers. And you could pitch all three. Like there's no mutual exclusiveness here. So data warehouse like it is really just grabbing your data and it's literally a data dump onto the Azure database. Azure is owned by Microsoft. Microsoft also owns Power BI. There's a seamless connection between Azure and Power BI allowing customers to look at that. And I will show both the data warehouse page in big-time as well as an instance of Power BI that I have on my computer. And just so we can visualize the differences as well. And to touch on Homsa's point too, Lauren, Remus brought up like a good phrase earlier to kind of like conceptualize data warehouse. Think of it as like DIY analysis. Like they already have a tool in place. They are probably getting information from like Bamboo HR, a CRM, but they also need to plug in big-time data that they can then manipulate further and customize those visuals the way that they want. Yeah and like that's really what it's used like the ultimate goal but what the data warehouse really does is just transfer that data. Like we have one customer I think who pays for the data warehouse just because they want access to their data like in case we run away with it I guess. Yeah that's another use case is like backup of data. So they may already have something in place or they just want to backup their data. Which account Neil? It's one of my funds. Network and Security Technologies. Oh got it. Thank you. Thank you. So like that's a perfect example like in Neil's customers case like they just want to grab their data. They just want to house it with themselves for whatever reason like security like and whatnot. Usually people do further take that into a Power BI solution but again it's not a necessity. But it is going to allow you to get there. And then with Power BI as Marty mentioned you can really intertwine data sets from multiple locations. You can intertwine them from Salesforce. You can intertwine them from Bamboo or Big Time or really like anywhere you can pull data out of. It'll take all the data kind of mesh it together and then you can get like a complete picture of what's going on. Like so I got a question this morning from sales where they were asking that a customer wants to get data into their Power BI solution and the salesperson suggested the warehouse but apparently they wanted to see if we could do it with APIs. Obviously they're all just a way to get data but APIs would more be like you manually making those requests versus the warehouse where we take all of your data and we just port it over to the Azure database. So they're both accomplishing the same thing of just like grabbing your data and kind of putting it in another spot for you to be able to further leverage it. And with a Power BI tool like it's also useful for customers that don't have one in place today. I had a conversation with Jamie this morning and we're really looking at like Power BI like a service over a product. The professional service team that like Ben Mulch and Steven are rolling out like they're going to be working closely with customers on like okay you want a BI tool like let's help you get an understanding of how to leverage that data and how to kind of like marry it together especially if they have multiple resources where they're pulling that data and need one single source of truth. This might be a dumb question but like how many different types of like BI are there? So you feel like Microsoft like we have our own or like are we using that Microsoft BI? It's usually using the Microsoft BI. Okay. BI is like business intelligence and that's kind of just visualizing your charts, seeing how your firm's performing. Power BI is like that trademark like Microsoft's own product and we're actually going to look into these right now because these are like really important to kind of understand what the difference between the three is. That probably is like one of the most important things to take away so I'm just going to show this and if there's any confusion please let me know. Yes Dave. Just one other note on that to build off what Marnie said the power the BI offering is meant to open up this to clients who don't really have like an IT staff or any of that stuff in place so it's it's building off of just like a normal data warehouse but specifically targeting people who don't have that or the means to do it so it should open up more clients for that reason. Yeah absolutely it's really giving them the means to be able to. Some people have the resources some people don't. That's also why we are offering dashboards is because even to get a Power BI set up you still need those technical resources whereas let's say an accounting firm like the CPAs might not really know what they're doing Power BI you might not want to go in there. It's like the Wild West for them so if you just go to big time go to your dashboards and you can see all the relevant information right there it's a lot easier for us to kind of engage a lot of those smaller firms as well. So data warehouse just a quick overview it is $6,000 per year as an upsell so there is an additional cost associated on top of your subscription. The main point I really want to cover is this is under the integration space just by the way there are six data sets that we export right so like when they ask what data can I get out of a data warehouse what is available to me so you can get your project data, staff data, transactional data, tasks, invoice, and allocations. Clicking into each of these will give you all of the fields that you can select so you can select everything or you can unselect some stuff like client name or a legal name or something but everything you select will be exported to your warehouse and some things even have custom fields on them like tasks I believe you can export your custom fields. So you just select which ones you want to export so now I'm going to be exporting all of them and now we're only going to focus on I guess I'll touch on both of them here. So there's two ways to export your data one is the nightly export so all you have to do is turn that on what that does is start exporting your data on a nightly basis starting like just overnight so every morning essentially your Azure database is going to be updated and then an enhancement that's coming out in the March release is going to be for these scheduled exports so when you turn it on you can select a frequency so let's say I want to select weekly on Monday 1109 a.m. now every Monday at 1109 a.m. I'm going to have my data exported so you can really export them twice per day on a scheduled basis so like the benefit we can kind of see from that is hey I just streamlined my data into my Azure database so the data that I have is always going to be up to date. So if you moved it to daily you can do it twice? If you moved it to daily yeah so daily that should have gone away so we will adjust that it's not live yet so this is just right right right. It would be twice a day. Yeah so then it would be nightly overnight and then let's say like if you have like a meeting at noon every day you might want to update it at 1130. So that's really where those use cases come out. Hey I have a presentation every Wednesday like our wallet team does Wednesday meetings to go over numbers. I'm sure they want updated numbers right before that meeting. So if you're going to lower new resources and ask for more than two is it fine to add to the frequency or is it just the two for now? Just the two for now. He's over that. No no he's asking for real time as well which I know we never make that kind of a deal. It was like as soon as I make an update I want my data warehouse to just export. Yeah immediately? Yeah immediately. On call. So any questions on like what the data warehouse can accomplish? Why you would kind of look at this? What your customer would benefit from? Because I'm gonna hop into Power BI after this. I just don't get like for I'm just trying for small businesses how I could sell data warehouse because it's just gonna be a bunch of data you need pretty much like an analyst to do something with that data on top of that now. Yeah usually not. I don't sell that. One of my customers is interested in it. We have dashboards. He's like I'm not gonna trust that. That's six grand. It's pretty rare that we sell that. Dashboard. Yeah the dashboard. That's what I'm going for. Dashboard. But for warehouse, that's going to be the biggest thing is combining different data tables. And then but what alternatives do I suggest they can use for visualization of data warehouse? What's the next like? Well I'm going to down a rattle hole. Data warehouse is just extracting data. You have to have something attached to it. Like data warehouse is just pulling wrong data and then it's up to them to say where they want to put it. Exactly so what I want to be the trust advisor in that whole thing. Power BI and Catalog. Or you want to try using... Yeah. And Power BI like I thought are... One is like not that expensive. But Power BI is not cheapest. There might be other ones. But I thought... You have a ballpark about what that looks like? No but I didn't... I honestly I think that depends on whether they have a Microsoft Office suite package that they're already paying for. Yeah but they can have Microsoft if you need it. That's what I'm... Thank you for... But Colton to directly address your question Colton. Your accounts might not be interested in just data warehousing. Some of them maybe but they're probably either just in dashboards or the offering in April where we do all of the setup with them and train them on it. That would be much more valuable to them because they don't have those kind of resources. Okay. Yeah that's exactly what BI is for those that don't have... That need help. That need that like consultative approach to marry data but also have a tool in place to be able to display that data. Okay. Perfect. And also it's like usually data warehouse like to Alexi's point like we don't sell a lot because a lot of our customers are like on the smaller end. We're obviously targeting more upmarket as we keep growing. But given our existing customer base like lots of them to your point they don't have those resources. They might not even have an external system like they might just be on big time. We might have gotten them off Excel spreadsheets. Yes. Right. So like if you don't have any data to marry from elsewhere if you don't have bamboo data coming in Salesforce data coming in. You only care about your big time data. Well your big time data is all available on dashboards. And that's where dashboards kind of distinguishes itself from Power BI is we can't you know take your bamboo data and put it in our dashboards. Right. Like it's data that already lives within big time that we can report on that is within the tile or the chart. Are we going down the path with dashboards to get cross table dashboards. That makes sense. Or a table. So like there are always a reporting request where I create it because it's to get on tables and you know. Oh so to the field are we ever going to. We. Is that kind of in the idea to go down that route or just kind of stick. I think I understand the question. I think we I solved that problem. BI does but I'm just wondering are we ever going to go down that route with dashboards. Not right now. Probably not like that seems like more of like a technical question to but like it's based it's based off reporting right so every time you click into a dashboard like you do get taken into a report. That's a report that generates it right you're just visualizing it so if we can't make the report because that's a report limitation that's that limitation is going to propagate to the chart as well. Yeah, yeah. I guess you break up tables. Or that BI can be pulling from other things just not just big time right. They have to be able to see this but like they want to see larger accounts accounts like they're going to have the BI in place and they would be more inclined to do it. Okay, so we are now just going to look at the BI since the questions kind of naturally went there anyway, which is great. So this is kind of a sample BI solution that we kind of strong together. So, what we can kind of see and like what I really wanted to point out here is we see like BT allocations BT invoices BT projects like if that was familiar, we just saw those on the data warehouse page, and that's why I wanted to show the data warehouse first. So we can see kind of underneath. We see all of our client information, like, you know, you see like all of these fields that you would start recognizing within big time. All those fields get pulled in and this is where we look at other stuff like I have Salesforce data in here so like everything propended with SF. So we have like SF account as a fleet SF opportunity if you're not familiar with an SF opportunity it maps to a big time project. So we can get the data here, and then I believe this data set also has opportunity children, which we don't currently map to a big time but they would map the tasks. So, using our VI, you're able to report on tasks that we don't have a big time, but we have in Salesforce. So we have a data where we have a big time limitation that we don't pull in tasks from Salesforce, but because I've imported Salesforce data here, I can report on those tasks, because I'm merging my big time and Salesforce data myself. Obviously like you don't just throw 10 data sets in and expect Microsoft Power BI to just pick it all up. There's a lot of data, like cleaning scaffolding like all that kind of stuff that goes into it. So that's one of the things you kind of see from Power BI and the reason I'm really showing this is because if your customer shows you something like this. I want you all to be able to like look at it and be like oh like that's Power BI, like I know what that looks like. You know like I'm familiar with it. I see the visuals or data warehouse like you know I know, like, you know, you have like that visual in your mind. That's really helpful. People are probably hear the terminology so much but it's like, what does it actually just look like, like if I see it like how do I recognize it. So, quick question on this, do we or will we have access to something like this that we can actually show clients in a demo like not the immediate term but I think eventually, it's kind of, I think you touched on it where, when we start offering like a BI as a service almost. And at that point like we'll be able to kind of start pre configuring things for them. But like right now it's just really a matter of taking those broad data sets that you have and just kind of for like reforming them in a way that you know like they play well with each other. Got it. Okay, thank you. When it comes to like the sales of data warehouse. One thing that I've run into a few times is when we're going through the demo we show them the data warehouse page, but then we, they don't have a really good understanding of how it connects to power bi, because they utilize it but they're not the best at adding in the SQL server or whatever, and adding that in as a dashboard. So even if we have like just a quick clip on how to do that, that we can provide in a demo for data warehouse, that would be really helpful. I think like that connection of showing them the data warehouse page and then how they take that string and put that in. Or, even if we have like a recording like we do like a premiere walkthrough like a data warehouse walkthrough where you can pull up your sample bi and like, and then you can like send that clip to people. Maybe narrated by somebody who's voiceover. Yeah, I think we're on to something here. But I think clients would like to see it in the same way too. Yeah, we can look into that. I feel like a lot of clients though like who are coming in like usually know that they need power bi because like they have those resources on hand and ready to go. Yeah. And then to answer like agency's question like there is that line up there that goes import data from a SQL server database. So it's literally like three four clicks to just get all of your data in there, which is why, like when we look at power bi, we reckon we recommend data warehouse because once the data warehouse has done its job. I just need to press import data from a SQL server database. And then it'll just, it'll import it straight from it, it took me like five minutes to get all of the data like just in there, and then bulk of the time was really just trying to get the data to form together. So the connection strings that we gave to those proper data warehouses, would those be on that side of just links up? Yeah, so ask them for like their server name and their password that's all in the connection string and last I spoke to Chris McDonald, he said that he sets up the warehouse and like puts in the connection string and everything for the customer, because he did that for me and I was like, Oh, that's so nice and he was like, I do it for everyone. I was like, okay. Not special. He says he does. He said like, Yeah, but he also puts it into the integration page and that's as far as he needs to go. Oh, so maybe I'm in their integration stage for them but then the customers responsible for actually like, they just need to set up their next step. Like they need to schedule their, like we're not going to turn on nightly export for them we're not going to turn on schedule. So nothing's going to export the connection will be set. So when we give someone the data warehouse, we establish the connection and then we give it to them, then they just need like their first step is to go in, select their data from like those six checkboxes I showed, and then just schedule, whatever your export cadences. And that's all the steps the customer needs to take like DevOps on our side hand the panels that up until, like, when it's just time to choose your data and how frequently you want it. So it's pretty straightforward in terms of, and then you'll just for like the power bi one like Tom's I was saying like you click into SQL Server and then it goes over, I think it's like Microsoft that you select and then you just add in all the information from the string. I think it's like two fields from the string and that's it. And both of these apps are owned by Microsoft, which is why it's like Azure and power bi are both Microsoft products, which is why there's a seamless just oh yeah just grab data from Azure like they basically expect it. I have a question for like larger accounts because I feel like a lot of these like build their own like API and things like that. What would be, I don't know, like what would be if someone has like something already built, like an API, then they don't need data warehouse it would just go right into. Yeah, I think it depends right like an API is just a singular call so API is like I think AP stands for access point. Okay, so it's just like an access point right like it's a singular call like, give me my project right like get get a project I'll give you the project. It's very much like a one to one request right like, okay, here's my request I need a project. Okay, here's your project back okay like, let me look at the project details okay like I need a task. Here's a task code, or give me the task back, you could write code. Okay, like, yeah, right like write a loop to just, you know, keep asking for every project. Okay, right. So that's how customers could do it but like that very heavily involved in building out a custom solution. Okay, like that's how we build out integrations like integrations with like QuickBooks or Sage like we just make calls to the API is. Okay, like oh someone created a project in big time let's use the API called to create a project and say, or QuickBooks or whatever. So like you're saying for us dying at this is more likely a much simpler. Oh yeah, they know exactly what they have to know. Right, so that's like how we position it. Yeah, like that. Yeah, the way to position it like this is the simplest way forward, right like there's really no overhaul on your part like we take care of both for you, like you just need to select what you want and when you want it like that's really what do you want when you want it, like you got to like that's as simple as it is. So if someone did have like a different solution in place, what may that look like? What type of solution did different be like, yeah, it will be a similar process. Oh, I did that from our side of the data warehouse which is a metal. They can import it from wherever like even if you don't use Microsoft like everyone let's like there's that get data button up there like you have like 1000 different ways that you can get data from an Excel work. Oh, got it. You can import data warehouse data from right so if they ask like, oh, like, how do I get data into my data where our power bi after it's been exported it's, you can import data from a SQL Server database using it but there's something called a dataverse I don't even know what that is right like I assume it's something like a data lake but bigger. We just do it in the metaverse. You can do it on the web, you can do blank queries like there's. And then there's more. So, like, okay, yeah like they literally like half their job is just where can we pull data and that's all they're looking for like power bi, they're just collecting like, oh, give me data from big time bamboo give me data from everything and then you play around with your data like I know that the Salesforce data that I see down here, right, like I know that an opportunity maps to a project. So, but power bi doesn't know that right that big time is not opportunities to projects. So I need to kind of create that link in power bi and let it know like hey like Salesforce opportunities. They're big time projects so that when Salesforce or power bi looks at the two data sets, it's like okay these two are the same time. Okay, so let's report on together. So just to kind of real quick I know we're moving through this and we haven't gotten to the actual dashboard. But there's so much. Yeah, I'm glad that people are learning about power bi and stuff. You really do need to understand all three to really be able to position one on why, like why one over the other. And like I said in the beginning, they're not mutually exclusive. You could theoretically sell it to a customer with all three. But like in this graph for example like it's revenue per state like it's a heat map showing me like my labor revenue in California versus like Nevada right like I think you can click on it and it's interactive. Right. Yeah, so like these, we can see started changing so. I think it's a smaller account and correct me if I'm wrong, thinking this like a small account may just stick with dashboards because maybe they're not doing much for you if they don't need all the visibility where like it seems to me like a larger account may have like trying to look at the term for. Yeah, like I would be hearing. Yeah, okay. Okay. Yep, that is spot on. Okay. So I have a client that has an API, but I pushed them towards data warehouse because they always talked to, they always submitted like questions about how to do things from the API and then I quickly realized that they're hiring it out. So they're hiring a whole separate it company to manage their API, which was just not sustainable because they're that company also had never worked with big time, and I was. So I noticed some things that were very confusing to them, so I'm pushing them towards data warehouse. In that case, okay. And that's a really good point like that is spot on like exactly why we would really put them towards it I guess sounds like we just hired a consulting firm to just build it out for them. And I, you pay like 160 per hour on that, depending on who you hire what their rate is but like it's not under like 150 per hour. So like once you add up like how many hours does it take to hit 6000 right like you're probably going to hit the 6000 and consulting hours within that first month whereas data warehouse is 6000 per year. And we just take it, take care of it for you. Okay. Any other questions like we saw like the data updating but unlike we saw the data sets here. We can see that like we have big time data we have Salesforce data. And then we kind of have these like sales metrics here, right, like a lot of that is really coming from Salesforce data. So like the opportunity levels, and like all that kind of stuff. So, like this is basically all Salesforce data without a lot of big time data. Whereas this is I believe more Salesforce data, plus big time data. And I can filter on things like project status project type client, and then I have like a lot of these metrics that Salesforce will offer me. So in that scenario I'm able to again like just intertwine my Salesforce and big time data. So that's the use case for this part. Okay. Interesting because Projector already has that built in. Yeah, I've been working with Richard a lot on. So it's like what's cool is like your resources can go in and have, whoops, basically those BI reports on the dashboard. Okay, back to this PowerPoint. All right, so all in all with dashboards, like in the past we've lost a lot of deals because of data visualization. Gone are the days when we're going to lose deals over data visualization because we are improving the visuals that we have. Think about today when we log in, you've got that static homepage. How many customers ask like, can we change the data in here? This isn't relevant. Can we remove the tile? That dashboard is eventually going away and is going to be replaced with the staff profile when they log in or their staff dashboard. But this is really where configurable dashboards come into play because it allows them to pull data into like tiles or insights based on maybe a specific like security group, whether it's a project manager or a finance manager, operation manager, and it's just more digestible for them to be able to take action to make those better business decisions. And that's a good segue into just like our different personas that would leverage configurable dashboards. Ideally, like all of our customers would benefit from this because it is data visualization. We get so many customers that want to be able to manipulate that data into like a bar graph or a pie chart. But just thinking about like our top three personas, that would really be like the targeted use case for dashboards. A project manager, so a project manager is always making sure that their projects are getting done on time. They're probably also sitting in weekly status meetings with stakeholders and have to present status updates on those projects. So having these dashboards quickly at a glance that they can then consume, break it apart and give that information to those stakeholders is key. It's also a way for them to either take corrective or preventative measures on a project because a lot of project managers work heavily with like risk analysis and trying to minimize the amount of risk to a project. From a finance manager standpoint, like they want to get a better hold on just like their cash trends overall, what's coming into the business. If they have 30,000 invoices that are 160 days outstanding, like that's an issue. And having these visualizations of like how many days outstanding are these invoices, who are my clients that are usually like the common repeat offenders, they're able to get ahead of that quickly. And then from an operations manager standpoint, just overall, when it comes to like staffing accordingly for projects and just having more baseline data to say, okay, this is where we started, this is where we need to go. And to be able to accurately forecast for future projects, having that baseline data and those metrics readily available is key. We'll talk about this, but I think we get asked this a lot, like can you share dashboards across multiple user groups? Yes, you absolutely can. And the user permissions really fall into that question because it's a completely separate group of settings in big time that allow you to create different security groups, whether it's based on a particular segment of their business, like operations, executive, finance, and they can share those dashboards across their organization. And just to like add to that, these leverage the security groups that the customers are used to, like the preexisting ones in big time, like the ones that they have set up already, like system admins, everyone, those are the two default, right? So then like whatever they add on top of that, finance, project managers, so every user group will be allowed to have one of these three permissions. So quick question on that, when you say share, does that mean I log in as a resource and I'm a specific user setting, will I only see the two reports on mine, or does that have to actually be like physically shared from a PM to someone else? You have to actually share it. Okay. With that security group. Like it will say system admin, it will say everyone, it will show you a list of your security groups and you can say like I want to share this dashboard to X1B. Got it. Okay. Yeah, we'll kind of, we'll touch on that because we have another interactive session for the dashboard. That's a great segue. Is it time for that? Oh, yeah. There we go. Okay. Let me just stop sharing. One more time. Can I be your buddy? Watch you. Oh. That's what we were. Okay. Okay, so if we can turn our attention to this screen, we are now looking at the dashboard. So I'm just going to kind of go through the basic functionality. I know everyone's been kind of playing around with it, but just in case you see something that you maybe hadn't seen or maybe if I touch on something you have a question about or maybe I didn't touch on something that you would like to see, we can kind of go through all that. So, not a great use case here. But if you guys look at your boards, you'll notice that, like, you saw something called a default board. I don't have that because I renamed it, but it would be default board and then you have three preselected tiles and two preselected inside tiles. So you have the default and then from there you can keep adding more. So there are two types of tiles. The first one is a graphical tile. The second one is an inside tile. So graphical tiles, as an HHS, they're graphs, bars, pies, lines. Insights are just data metrics. So something that's just rolled up into a single number. So underutilized staffers, total tasks due, overdue, right? Like how many tasks are, I can just see that in a data metric. Versus like something like task status, where I can see how many are in QA, how many are in to-do, how many are not started. I can flip through different boards. So I have these four boards. So this one has role utilization. So which role logged the most hours in the month of November of 2022? My production assistant logged, what is that, over 150 hours, whereas my project manager logged like 20-something. I have 26 unpaid invoices, and so I'm actually going to... This one isn't set up the way I wanted it to be. Sorry about that. Someone changed my demo site. There we go. Okay, so that's the default dashboard. I've obviously added more to it, as most people have, but once you do see that you do want to add things to it, there's that add tile button. So clicking on this one will allow you to add a graphical tile. Clicking on this one will allow you to add an inside tile. So opening this up, and I'm really trying to use some simple terminology just so that we're all aligned on how we would go about talking about it with a customer. If I say something that you don't get, please just stop me. So this opens up almost like a catalog page, right? Just think like a menu or a catalog or just a list of options, to put it in the simplest terms. We have these data categories on the left, so like workflow management, staffing and capacity, so everything that is really related to staff can be here. Anything with invoices, anything with categories, there is a search bar. So if I want to look for my AR aging, or I can just look for aging, it doesn't have to like start with it. So like risk, what are the things associated with risk? Oh, projects at risk. So I can kind of do two things. The first thing I can do is I can quick add any tile. So what quick add is going to do is it's going to just take this tile and it's going to take me back to the board that I started on. So I started from default dashboard and it put it down here. So projects at risk. Right. So what this really is showing me is a list of my projects. The total that's been invoiced and the total estimated show me how much is remaining. So I can see which ones are going over budget, which ones are close to over budget and so forth. The second thing way to really get there is to go into the details page and then you'll see a list of options here for you to choose from. Each chart will have slightly different options. Projects at risk just have a display name. So let's say I don't really see it as at risk. I just like I think this makes more sense to me to be project budget status. Right. Like it's really just showing me my budget. I don't necessarily have to look at it at risk. I can rename it right here so that I can go ahead if I add that tile. This is where the different workflow does come in. It actually gets put into this container. You can kind of think of it like a cart. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like almost like a shopping cart. Right. Like I can exit out here. It's still up here. So it's like you know you add something to your Amazon cart. It stays there. Right. You can kind of go in and start mass adding things as well. So if I click on role utilization, I'll see that this one has a date range that I can apply to it. So I'm like, OK, let me look at who the most productive was in like the most productive role and actually don't want all the data. Let's say in January, which role was the most heavily demanded in January. So then you can even rename this to be like a little more intuitive. So heavy rules in January. That is really customizable. And so the thing I want to show here is once we have two things in here, we can see that we have information on them. So what the actual chart is, what that display name is. So the display name is project budget status. What that chart type is. It's a table. And then there's this published to. So this published to actually shows all of your dashboards. So I am just looking through and I'm like, oh, well, the default dashboard has this chart on there three times now. It does. Maybe I want to add it to somewhere else. Like maybe Steve needs to see it. So I'm just going to throw that on Steve's dashboard. I'll keep role utilization on my default dashboard so I can go ahead and just publish both of those tiles. And then I can see on my default dashboard there's heavy rules in January. It's just gathering that data, running the report. And then if we hop over to Steve's dashboard, we can see project budget status here. So similar to how you would share reports like the public report section or the allocation section of the report center. You can share those to the actual boards that you have created on the top. And then the actual boards correspond with user rights. Yes. Yeah. And then insights follow just the same path. So it's literally the same. Some of them just have a display name. Some of them have a date range. And that literally just comes from the type of chart like unbilled expenses, for example. You're not really going to have a date range or like current draft invoice amount. Like in that situation, you really just want to know what the outstanding amount is. Whereas things like total allocated hours, like we do want a date range on there because I want to see who's allocated in February, who's allocated in March, who's allocated this quarter. So it just depends on what makes sense where. But that is all defined when we create those charts. Are those physical fields like dynamic or is it always going to be stagnant? Like you'd be like, OK, I want to see allocations for next month, this month, or is it only going to be a strict certain dates? It's always going to be strict certain dates. Well, sorry, scratch that. It depends on the chart, I think, because there's one called upcoming projects due. So that just looks at projects that are whose due date is past today. Right. And then it shows you like when they're due. I think it's in one of these. The only one that's like that. Yeah, I think currently that's the only one that's like that. Wow, I feel like this is really going to make our customers be forced to use big time in a whole new way. Right. Like people, just some customers who haven't gone through like their workflow and just processes like to get this date like data correct, you're going to have to do like a, you know, like a new session on how you are inputting things, projects, tasks. Well, that's just a student. They're utilizing the functionality. Yeah, right. Well, that's a really good call out. I think that's going to dovetail nicely with our professional services team here, because then it's like, well, hey, let's get in with them. Let's get you all corrected and set up. And then this will all be a lot more useful for you. Yeah, I think once you get real data in there and you kind of see something like kind of, you know, like, oh, look, I have 100% billability. That's nice for me to look at when I log in in the morning like a or aging like, wow, that's an actual pilot. Looking at firm financial like you can see your revenue chart. So in this scenario, like, we can see like what our revenue over the entirety of 2022 was. I don't have any billable charges, but like you can really group these. So I'm going to like kind of just show like that. For since we kind of cover the tiles, I just want to get through the board and like that permission steps. So your board options are over here, and this little menu option here. And there's a couple option there's refresh dashboard, which is going to just pull all your data again. Just refreshing your data. You can edit your dashboard or you can delete your dashboard. I'm just going to delete it. What's the, what's like, is there an auto refresh time, auto sync on it, or are they going to have to do like if they click out or something. If they click in and back out, it will not update because we pull from cache for speed. And so the updates are when we go. So they're saved data, right. And that's cache like we pull save data. You can either force a recompile of data from refresh dashboard. Right. Right. So that'll force a repulse if I just press it, we'll see like everything started updating right and tight updating. And then you can see like the last refresh time is also updating. There is an auto refresh rate of, I believe it is about, I think it's a 24 hours. So if your data is older than 24 hours, then we're going to update it. So we're never showing you, we never show you data older than 24 hours. So we just, we pulled everything. This is just no data display because I don't have data I guess. Okay. So when you go ahead and add a new dashboard, right, and keep in mind we have a maximum of five. So this is my fifth dashboard. I have two options here when it comes to what I need to do. So the first one is a board name. I can say like finance or operations and then choose groups to share with. And this is where those user groups were really playing in that we looked at earlier. Right now, the only user group that is allowed to use configurable dashboards is just some administrators. And if you notice here, I actually can't remove them. And that's very intentional. You can never remove a system administrator from seeing a board. So I'm just going to add that. And then I just wanted to get, so another user group in there. So if your customer says, how do I get another user group into dashboards? How do I enable it? You'll go under user rights. So I only have these two configured. So this is where I was saying like these are leveraging the existing groups that we already have. So we can say this can be my operations, but like just imagine how your customers are kind of forming those. So then the dashboard permissions are located under dashboards. And so these are the three that Marnie pointed out earlier. You can either have view dashboard, which is a read only permission. You can look at it. You can flip through the dashboards that's been shared with you. You cannot add a tile. You cannot edit a tile. You cannot add a dashboard. You cannot delete a dashboard. You cannot share a dashboard. It is read only. So it's only for one dashboard within the whole feature. That is for your user group. They have to be given access to each individual dashboard. Yes. And I'll show that right as soon as I get another group to show off. Because we only saw one group. Because only one group was enabled. So it'll show you all the groups that have at least a read permission. So I can say these are my operations. I'm going to give them full access. So you can add and delete dashboards. That also comes with, obviously, cascaded down. If you can add and delete a dashboard, you should be able to add and delete the contents within the dashboard. And you should also be able to look at what you're doing. Add and delete a dashboard that has already been shared with that group, right? So if you turn this on for operations, they're only going to be able to do that, though, on the dashboards that have been shared by the system admin with operations, right? Or you could add a new one. Okay. Gotcha. But they can't. So, right. But what I'm saying is if there's a group of dashboards that's shared with project managers, right? And then you give this user right to operations, operations can't go and change the project managers that have been shared. No, not unless it's also been shared with operations. So think of it almost like a Google Doc. I can invite people to a Google Doc. Right? Exactly. Like who's a viewer? Who's a commentator? Who's an editor? It's like we very much modeled it off like the same. System admins are the only ones who can see everything. Yeah. And so that's really like Daniel brought up a good point where what if I have one dashboard that's shared with operations, but not project managers are like the other way around, but it doesn't really matter. But we only allow a maximum of five per firm. If I've shared two dashboards with operations, three dashboards with finance, operations sees two, finance sees three, neither of them can add another dashboard. Oh, one group is going to add two. Okay. Other groups are going to add three. What the heck? Which is why system administrators. System admins are the ones that control that. Right. So, and I'm also going to go here just to kind of show it. Well, it's the same thing that if like everyone. So, system admins would always have five no matter what to see. Assuming that they have five tiles. But like if someone goes and builds a tile. Yeah. If someone goes and builds a tile, that counts towards the five, right? Or no? Like say they give a user right to like a PM or something or a dashboard and then the PM builds a dashboard, but the system admin already sees five. Is that like what we're doing? No. What I think basically we're asking the same thing. Five total, right? Medium. If a system admin builds four and then a PM goes and builds another one, you're at that five. Yeah. So, if no one else is. Exactly. Okay. So, if we edit this real quick. So, I guess the other one did. So, the everyone user got added. Sorry. Let me just. Operations, dashboard. Oh, that is. All right. So, every user who has at least a view only permission will be a part of. So, if I go to edit dashboard, it's that same ad. Oh, there they are. It's that same ad dashboard pop up, but now it just says edit. But I can edit the name. Let's say I just wanted to shorten this to ops. And then I'm like, okay, I need to also show this operations. So, once I gave the permission to the group, they now show up under this list that they didn't show up under before. So, this list is generated from every group who has at least a view permission. So, if a group doesn't have any permissions for dashboard, they're not going to show up here as an eligible group. And even though I have three of them now, I still can't get rid of system admins because someone in the company needs to be able to see all five boards. Otherwise, it's going to be a goose chase. So, to get around that, let's see. We added the board. We have it. We're at five. So, this is what it says. For those of you who can't read because it is small, you have reached your organization maximum of five dashboards. If you need to remove a dashboard to add a new one or contact your system administrator, that last bit is in there, again, because not every group could see five. So, we need to ensure that at least one group can see all five. Okay. Any other questions? Can they have more than five? No. Even if we try to sell it, it's a limitation. Five is the premium package. So, we have four minutes left. Tom, is there anything else you want to show on this feed? I thought I would take the question. I think that's everything. And I just wanted to really just point out that in terms of sharing, like, why would a user have more multiple dashboards? How do security groups play into it? I can share this with, like, operations and system administrators, right? So, operations and system admins see this. But then maybe Steve's dashboard, like, I want to show everyone because I don't know. Yeah, because our customers want flexibility based on, like, their business needs. And we need to digest it for different people. So, if you want, and here's the key thing about, like, the selling piece, which is why I wanted to touch on this before we run out of time, is if you want to share the dashboard with a specific user group, you need more than one dashboard. Because if I only have this default dashboard, I only have one board. So, I pretend these aren't there. Either I'm going to be doing something like this, where it's, like, a very mixed set of data that is shared with, you know, like, I can't just share half the tiles with one group and half the tiles with another group, right? Like a whole board. Right. So, it's like system admins only can see this whole board. I can't say, oh, can everyone see the top half of this board and ops see the second half of this board? Like, buy a separate dashboard and then you can, again, think Google, right? Like, you can't share page one of your Google Sheet with one group and share page two with another group. You share one workbook with one group, another workbook with another group. So, it's, you know, if you want to share user groups, if you want multiple groups to see different groups or different dashboards, sorry, then that is a great point to be like, okay, like, let's try to upsell this. Yeah. That's all I had. Marnie? Can current customers be part of the beta group? Sorry, I was going to, like, pull up your PowerPoint back up, but I think we have... So, TTC sent some really great questions. I know she also surfaced these questions with the team. So, Hamza and I created a dashboard FAQ that I'll send out along with this deck and it will also be in the content library. So, I just want to make note that we probably won't get through all the questions, but they are documented in here. But I know there's two big ones. One is current customers cannot be part of the beta group because it's closed. There's not any reason to why we have, I guess, a specific subset of customers that are part of the beta group. We can't continue to add additional ones now that it's closed. And quite frankly, any feedback that they would provide now wouldn't make it into the release next month on March 23rd. That's not to say that you can't submit feedback on behalf of the customer through Pendo, though. I know everybody's aware. I know Hamza's told the team, too, that you're able to do that. And I think you select beta. Yeah. The other question is, what are some future product enhancements that we can expect with dashboards? I will answer that question in the internal update email, so we don't need to spend our remaining bit of time on that. Great. It'll take me much more than a minute. So, please look out for another internal update email with what's kind of coming. Yeah, I think our takeaway here is start generating the hype around dashboards. Hamza made a really good call out about start those pre-orders now so that when it's ready, you can re-engage with those customers. Create your own little tracker if you have customers that are interested. I know marketing is working on sell sheets, product one-pagers, screenshots. But all of you have access to show dashboards today, even if our customers don't have access right now. And then I'll follow up with the training deck along with the FAQ. And then I'll just send out a post-training survey just to make sure that everybody feels like their needs were met today. And if there's still gaps, Hamza and I can work together to close those. Yeah, and if you have any follow-up questions or if you think of a question like an hour later, maybe you're, you know, had a shower thought, I don't know. Just like feel free to like flag me and Marnie like, hey, just thought about this. Like, what do we do here? Like, what about what, you know, just need some clarification here. Like, whatever it may be, like anything you feel, even the training that I missed or didn't get, just let us know. And there will be a second training next month around the value and messaging around it. So we know this is an urgent request because you can't show it to anyone, you're getting questions from customers. We're not going to do a certification, this training. There most likely will be a certification next month. We roll out some of the value and messaging around it once marketing has finished up with that. Is that an OCR? And then, yeah, dashboards are available March 23rd. And in OCR, they will not be available March 8th in the normal monthly release. Real quick, Hamza, you mentioned slacking you and Marnie with questions. Is it all right if I add you, Hamza, to the CSM questions channel to keep all of this centralized? Sure. Yeah. Get ready. Excellent. I know what that's like. I mean, it's either that or I could add everyone to the internal dashboard group since the SOCON is already in a group. I feel like it would make more sense to have you and we could tag you if it's like a dashboard question. Sure. We're not getting too much into your group. Right. Keep it focused on dashboards with Hamza in that channel. You are officially added, Hamza. Yeah. We'll add it to the SOC so everybody has it. All right. Thanks, team. Thank you. Thanks, everybody. Bye. Thanks, team. Thanks, team.
