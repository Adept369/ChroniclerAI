Welcome to BigTime Wallet, our online payment processing platform. By the end of this video, you should feel comfortable with the process of configuring your wallet setup. By the time you start watching this video, you should have received a notification that your wallet application has been approved. To confirm that your application has been approved, you can go to the BigTime Wallet page within the BigTime Integrations section. By selecting My Company, the Integrations option, by selecting BigTime Wallet Tile, you will see a green status bar marked as approved. This indicates that your wallet application has been approved and you are ready to begin the setup process. The setup process is a quick three-step process that you can begin immediately upon approval. To start the process, you can either click on any of the links here in the BigTime Wallet status page, or go to the Configure Options page by selecting Invoicing on your top navigation bar and then selecting Configure. Once the Configure box opens up, you can proceed to the Payments tab on the very right-hand side. These three sections, Styles, Accounts, and Defaults, entail the BigTime Wallet configuration process. The Style Setting tab specifically pertains to setting up what is referred to as the Payment Landing page. This is a page that your client will see when they click on the wallet link to make a payment. As you can see, there is a Classic and Modern option for you to choose from. In addition, you can set the button color, the button text color, the text color, as well as the line and accent color to your liking, as well as include your company logo on the landing page. Once you have selected a style to your liking, you can save the template for all future invoices sent out with the wallet link. This is a one-time setup and does not need to be configured for each invoice you send out. If you would like to see a preview of the style settings you've just configured, on the right-hand side, you can select Generate Payment Portal Preview, and this will display all of the settings that you've configured within the Style tab here. Before moving on to the Account Settings tab, however, you'll just want to make sure that you select Save, and then you can go ahead and move on to the next step of the wallet configuration process. The Account Settings tab is catered to all big-time users that will also be concurrently using QuickBooks as well. The settings you select here set up your QuickBooks accounts that are used through the entirety of the process from when the payment is initially submitted to then deposited into your bank account. To receive full benefit of this integration, and to ensure payments flow through to QuickBooks, it is critical that the invoice is posted to QuickBooks prior to sending out to the client. The settings here specifically state where the payments will flow to and how they will be reconciled within QuickBooks. As long as the invoice was posted to QuickBooks prior to client payment, then once they make the payment, the transaction will flow through to QuickBooks and be deposited or posted in this Undeposited Funds section. When the payment gets deposited and flagged as such in big-time, a transaction will run which will create four journal entries within QuickBooks. Two entries will be credited creating the Undeposited Funds, one for the amount that will be deposited into the bank account, and one for the amount taken out for transaction fees. In addition, two debit entries of equal value will be created, one for the amount that will be deposited into your primary bank account here, and one for the transaction fees to be taken out and deposited into the expense account selected here. One thing to mention is that QuickBooks integration is not required to use big-time wallet, nor do you have to have payments flow through to QuickBooks if you do not want to. This integration is built so that you can continue to collect payments within big-time from the same solution that the invoice was sent out of while being able to fully reconcile your accounts within QuickBooks. Before moving on to the final part of the configuration process, you'll just want to make sure that once you select your primary bank account from the dropdown here, as well as the transaction fees for the expense account selected here, you'll need to select Save, and then you can move on to the last piece, which is the default section. This is centered around default payment method settings. This is a convenient tool for the user if you are sure that you will be offering the same payment methods to all of your clients. Whether ACH or credit card, or both are selected, as long as the Save button is hit at the bottom, this will be the default option for all invoices to be sent out. However, please keep in mind that if you would like to tweak the settings for certain clients and projects, you can do that on the specific page for that invoice. Whatever payment methods you select there will always override what you have selected in the default payment method settings page here. This completes the configuration of your wallet setup. In our next video, we will walk through how you can utilize the big-time wallet feature when you begin sending out invoices to your clients. Thank you!
