While the focus of this course has been on task type reports, you can also utilize project type reports to see budget status and financial information. That would be useful when you don't need to see the breakdown of each task, you just want to see the overall health and budget data for your project. So I'm going to select this project list type and then click next. So of course under the project details section you're going to see general project information such as status, start date, cost centers, things like that. I am going to add the project name and the due date. You can scroll through those project details, continue scrolling, looking at the information you have available at your disposal. If you have any project custom fields, you can add those to these report types too. I will continue scrolling and we've gotten to the client information section. So I'm going to add the client name, but I'm actually going to move that column to the front of this report. So we had gotten to the client section. If we continue scrolling through this list, you will see that we end up at the budget information. So I can add the total estimate that includes both fee and expense budgets, can add the hourly fee estimate, which I will do, and the dollar fee estimate, which I will add as well. Because this is a project type report, all those task estimates for your budgets will roll up into a single project level value. Continue scrolling and now we are at the budget status information section. This is where you'll dive into that financial data at the overall project level. So you can see the estimate versus what you've actually invoiced. For those health and profitability purposes, you can see margin data. We have those two right here, but I'm actually going to search the word margin. And if you do search that keyword margin, you'll notice that there are various margin fields in these project type reports. The section that those columns are housed in really determines where that information is pulled from, like say the overall budget status. Again, if you do hover over any of those fields, it will give a description of how that field is being calculated. You can see the margin information specifically for the fees, or if you wanted to see it based on the time and expenses, you could have that information either at a date range level for a specific period in time, or it could be for all of the time and expenses you've logged to date. You'll also notice these current margin fields. Our standard margin field calculates against time and expenses that have already been placed on an invoice, whereas this current margin field is going to tell you the billable charges versus the input costs before those time and expense entries have been placed on an invoice. This is really going to be helpful if you want a better idea of what your margin is going to be before you're actually invoicing your clients for those charges. These current margin fields are also available in our task type reports, as well as time and expense type reports. So let's say you wanted to see the overall margin for the invoice that's going to give you the percentage. So I am going to include this overall margin invoice versus costs column. But you can also see the dollar amount as well, and I am going to include that. The project reports are also going to allow you to see realization information. So if I type into the search bar realization, you'll see a slew of columns come up. So you can see the overall realization, the total invoice to date divided by the total expense costs, plus the total input time charges. Project reports are really good for financials because you can see that margin and realization data in a single report. You also have the option of seeing the overall realization with fees and expenses, or just the fee realization. But for profitability purposes, I am actually going to delete my search and scroll all the way down to the time and expense to date section. So here we are, and I am actually going to include the total cost. So right here. Then if we scroll down a bit more into the invoice information, here's the invoice details, I am going to include the total invoice to date. Again, included those two columns mainly for profitability purposes. Also another thing I wanted to highlight is again, I can click this link at the top to activate the column super headers. So I want to group my margin fields actually. So I'll click into this margin column, I activated those super headers. Now I can click into this top field here, and then margin, save my edits, and then extend that super header over to the other margin column. Perfect. Now these are all the fields I want to include in my report. I will click create report, title it project budget financials, and publish my report. So now that the report has been published, you can see the client name, the project names, their due dates, the hourly estimate and the fee estimates, as well as the margin data denoted by the super header, as well as the total cost for the project, as well as what has been invoiced to date for those projects as well. Now the client column is currently showing a flat list here, but I can also click into the client column header, which will dynamically group the projects by client for me. You should now feel comfortable crafting a project type report to include base project information, budgetary information, as well as financial data in order to give you a holistic view of your project health and profitability. Thank you.
