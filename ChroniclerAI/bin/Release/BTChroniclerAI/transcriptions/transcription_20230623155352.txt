Hi there everyone and welcome to Dashboards. Built right into the BigTime platform, Dashboards arrange your data into digestible visuals so you can make better decisions, surface problems faster, and take action to improve results. All to keep the focus on delivering for customers and the business. Now let's get started configuring your Dashboards. Because it is an add-on feature, we'll begin by activating Dashboards by going My Company, My Company, Active Features, then toggle Dashboards on. Go ahead and save it. Close this menu. Refresh your page. And now you'll see that when you click the Analytics tab in the navigation bar, Dashboards is now on the list. Go ahead and click that. And welcome to your default BigTime Dashboard. This is my pre-created default Dashboard with the unapproved time and unbilled WIP Insight tiles, and the AR aging, hours, scorecard, and total profit large data tiles. At a high level, Dashboard tiles pull existing data from within BigTime and allow you to view it in one of two tile types. Large data tiles, which include a number and a graph or chart, and their smaller counterpart, Quick Insight tiles, which only display a number. But there can be no more than eight large data tiles and six Insight tiles per Dashboard, 14 tiles total. You can create a maximum of five Dashboards in BigTime. If you've maxed out on Dashboards, you can always delete a Dashboard later on. You can also share each Dashboard with a unique set of security groups you've created in your user rights. I'll go My Company, User Rights, and these are your currently existing security groups. Now, staff are also granted differing levels of Dashboard access based on the security group they're part of. So if you click into a group, and in the Dashboards section of the user rights, the three dedicated user rights are View Dashboards, which is basically read only, Allow user to edit Dashboards, and finally Allow user to add and delete Dashboards, which is also inclusive of editing. When using BigTime's Dashboards, each team may wind up needing one. So let's create a new Finances Dashboard from scratch. First, we'll click Add New. Here you'll name your Dashboard, as well as select the security groups you'd like to share it with. Because it's a Finances Dashboard, let's share it with just the Finances team. You can't unselect admins, as they can see everything in your BigTime site. Also note that the only security groups you'll see in this list are ones with the View Dashboards user right turned on. It's a best practice to create multiple user groups with different permissions so you can share Dashboards across teams. Perfect. We will click Add Board, and voila, time to add some tiles. I want to add some large data tiles first, so I'll click the Larger Add Tile button. This is the library of large tiles. Let's hone in on financial info by selecting the Firmwide Financials category on the left. First, we'll add Amount Invoiced. Click into the tile, and you're taken to a new window where you can set a date range for the displayed info, rename the tile's display name, or choose to filter the data by one of your cost centers. We're just going to add tile. And here's our cart with the tile we want to publish. We could delete the tile from the cart as well as continue editing the tile before publishing, but we're just going to publish it. Back to the large library, Quick Add does exactly that and adds the tile to the dashboard without any configurations. We're going to quick add the Total Profit tile. Scroll down a bit. We'll quick add that. And go back to add the AR Aging tile as well. Now that those large data tiles have been added, let's add some quick insight tiles. Click the Smaller Add Tile button on the left. This is the library of smaller insight tiles. Same steps as the larger data tiles, either clicking into the tile to configure any settings or just quick adding them to your dashboard with no configuration. I will quick add Unbuild WIP, Unbuild Expenses, Unbuild Time, Current Draft Invoice Amount, and two more I want. I'll scroll down a little bit. I want to add AR Aging as well as the number of unpaid invoices. Once the desired tiles have been added to your new dashboard, feel free to drag and drop them in their respective areas to create the custom view that you need. Clicking into any chart will then display the report behind the chart. This data is what will be driving the visualization. Now that your dashboard has been created, stay up to speed on your firm's latest performance. If your data is under 8 hours old, we display the old data. If your data is older than 8 hours but less than 24 hours old, we'll display the old data, but we start updating that data in the background. Refreshing the browser after around 5 minutes should show that new data. Finally, if your data is older than 24 hours, then we regenerate the data before displaying everything. You can also manually refresh your dashboard. In the upper right corner of your dashboard, you'll see an icon with three lines. Click that and a pick list will generate with a few options. Click Refresh Dashboard. And after a few seconds, you'll see your current date and time reflected in the upper left corner. Do note though, your dashboards can only be refreshed once every hour. So on our new dashboard, I will try and refresh that. And as you can see, I am met with an error asking me to wait one hour between refreshing dashboards. Following those steps will only refresh the dashboard you have open. If you have multiple dashboards for different groups and want to refresh them all at once, you'll need to go into each individual dashboard and update them one by one. Your firm's priorities may also change, meaning at some point you may need to edit certain dashboards or delete them entirely. Here's how to do that. We're going to start by clicking that button with the three lines at the top right. And other than refresh, the other two options are to edit or delete the dashboard. Let's edit this dashboard. A new window pops up where you can change the name. And make edits to who will be able to see it. I will check the box next to Managers. Now our system admins and managers will be able to view the general dashboard. Once you're satisfied with your changes, click Edit or to save them. And now to delete the dashboard, go to the three lines button and select that last option, Delete Dashboard. A new pop-up is going to ask if you're sure. Yes, I'm sure. We'll delete the board. And remember, deleting a dashboard is permanent. You won't be able to recover it once it's been deleted. Alongside editing and deleting entire dashboards, even your tiles are built to be edited. You can edit the date range, the name of the tile, as well as change the cost center filter. Go to one of the tiles on your dashboard, click these three dots in the upper right corner of the tile, then select Edit Date Range. You can then choose between a monthly, quarterly, or yearly date range, as well as click the arrows on the left or right to select that month, quarter, or year. Once you've made your changes, click Apply to save those changes. You can see that new month in the upper right, but you can also open the advanced editing settings for your tile. Click those three dots again, and this time select Edit Tile. Here, you can change the name of your tile. I'm just going to call it Hours. Change the time period, which we've already just changed, as well as apply a cost center filter. I'll apply a location of Chicago. Once I am done, I will click Edit Tile and automatically redirect it back to my dashboard, where you'll see the new date range that we've already applied, the name of the tile, as well as the filtered data set based on that cost center. In case you need to delete a tile, the last option in this menu is exactly that. Go ahead and delete. Once you click Yes, that will be gone, and you will see the notification that says Tile Deleted at the top of your screen. That completes our configuration walkthrough of BigTime dashboards. You should now feel comfortable creating, editing, sharing, and deleting in BigTime's preeminent in-app data visualization feature. Thank you.
