Hi there everyone. During this session we are going to walk through the utilization of the time and materials with deposit invoice calculator. We'll start with creating the manual invoice for the prepayment or deposit amount, applying the deposit on future invoices, then ensuring the remaining deposit amount is displayed properly on those invoices. The time and materials with deposit invoice calculator allows you to receive a prepayment or deposit from a client to then pull from on future invoices. This style of billing is most often seen with IT services or IT consulting firms. This calculator uses the standard time and materials format but adds a credit for fees based on any deposits previously billed. I say adds a credit for fees because this deposit or prepayment does not count towards expenses. Those are still passed through on the invoice. Once the calculator is imported in your big time site, it will add two custom fields to your project dashboard, deposit amount and deposit minimum. Note that the deposit amount will be added to your next invoice each time the accrued deposit dips below the value specified in the deposit min or minimum field. If this prepayment is just a one-time thing not to be replenished, you can leave that deposit min field blank. I also want to highlight that you will see other calculator types containing the with deposit label like fixed fee with deposit or item based billing with deposit. You can utilize these different with deposit styles on the same project and still pull from the same deposit throughout the life of the project. No new custom fields will be created when importing the other with deposit style calculator types. They all pull from the same deposit amount and deposit min fields set up at the individual project level. To start, we will first navigate to the invoicing configure tab and then to calculators. As you can see, I have already imported and turned on the TNM with deposit calculator, but if you haven't, you'd access it in this gallery of available calculators here at the bottom of the page. This is also where you'd be able to bring in those other with deposit calculators like fixed fee or item based. Now we can navigate to the project that we're going to be creating this deposit for. Select the details tab and scroll down to the bottom of the page. Here you'll see those two new deposit fields. As a quick example of when you'd utilize this calculator, let's say you have a client that pays you $5,000 up front and wants you to deduct their future invoices from that prepayment. We will then input that $5,000 prepayment into the deposit amount field and this is a one time deposit, so I will leave this min field empty. Then I'll save my changes. Next, we need to create that initial deposit invoice. We will navigate invoicing overview, click create invoice in the upper left and select the project with the prepayment. Next, here I will select the TNM with deposit calculator. Clicking next. You'll see we have any previously logged time that is associated with that project, but we also have this locked line item for the deposit amount. For example, in an effort to keep a cleaner workflow, I want this invoice to be strictly for the deposit, so I will actually uncheck this box, dropping the time from the invoice back into the whip tile. Then I will click finalize. Once this invoice is created, you can then send it to the client. You can apply payment to this initial deposit invoice whenever you'd like. It is not required to be paid off first in order to pull from the deposit on future invoices. You can then choose when you would like to apply this deposit to those future invoices, whether it's on the very next invoice, the very last one, or over the course of multiple invoices. If you are choosing to not use the deposit against an invoice, then just use the standard TNM calculator or any of the other calculators without the with deposit label. A quick workflow tip, in order to differentiate which of your invoices are for deposits and which are regular bills against the client, I've seen customers put a signifier in front of their invoice number, like AD or just D. That way they can tell the purpose of each invoice at a quick glance. Now that we've created the initial deposit invoice to pull from on future invoices, we can now fast forward into the future and act as if we are now ready to bill that project's whip and apply the initial prepayment deposit. I will go back to the invoicing overview page. I'll actually click into my whip tile. And as you can see, I do have that $2,400 worth of time logged to the King's Landing project. I'll click that blue $2,400 amount and then the create invoice dropdown. Here I will select the TNM with deposit invoice. Note, if you were to click any other calculator that did not include the with deposit moniker, the prepayment would not be applied to the invoice. As you can see now, we have that time attached, but its amount is being subtracted by the deposit credit. Because this is a TNM type invoice, you can actually subtotal by whatever you'd like. I will choose to subtotal by task, then click finalize. We have now finalized the invoice with the whip line item and the deposit line item that shows your previous deposit balance and the new remaining balance in the line item note. This invoice itself has been zeroed out and any future invoices will pull from that remaining balance amount until it has been completely depleted. Now while we as the invoice creators see the line item note displaying the prior balance and the new remaining balance, you may or may not want that info to be displayed on the invoice when sending it to the client. In order to ensure that your clients will see that prior and remaining balance, that is actually controlled by the PDF style used when sending the invoice. Next we'll navigate to the preview tab of the invoice to select the PDF style we'd like to use. I will actually select the invoice line items King's Landing style, a PDF I've specifically made for this project, which I do suggest doing for any other clients that have specific invoice information requirements. But as you can see for this one, the deposit line item note is not displayed. To turn it on, we will navigate invoicing, configure, PDF styles, select the invoice line items King's Landing style, then click edit. Now because the prior and remaining balance information is input onto the invoice as a line item note, we will scroll down to the lines section of the PDF creation wizard. While we already have lines included on the invoice in this PDF, we currently only have the line item name selected to be shown. To include that balance information, we will need to select show both name and note. And finally, save our changes. Now we can close out of there and refresh our page. Navigate back to that preview tab of the invoice, select the invoice line items King's Landing PDF style, which we just edited, and now both the line item name and the note have been included on the client's invoice. In the case that you don't want this balance information being displayed on the invoice sent to the client, just note that you can always view the deposit balance by utilizing a project list type report and including any deposit related columns. That concludes our walkthrough of the time and materials with deposit calculator workflow. You should now feel comfortable inputting the deposit amount and minimum into the two custom fields at the project level, creating the initial deposit invoice, applying that prepayment towards future invoices based on the style of billing you use, and finally, ensuring the client can see their prior and remaining deposit balance. Thank you.
