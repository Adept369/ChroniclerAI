In this video, we'll walk through how to set up project templates for both our Pro and Premier users. As a project manager or system admin, creating projects can take a lot of time out of a person's day. Assigning basic settings and creating tasks can add up to hours of work. Having the option to create project templates will speed this process up immensely, allowing for users in big time to be more efficient in their day-to-day activities. A firm can create as many templates as they need. Before we dive into setting up project templates, a system administrator will need to activate this feature, and this can be done by going to My Company, My Company, Active Features, and turning on Project Templates. One thing to note is that once you save, you may just need to refresh your page so that when I go back into My Company, I will now see Project Templates as a separate feature in my big time site. Once activated, a user will be taken initially to a blank screen. However, I've been playing with project templates today, so you'll see quite a few already added in my site. To begin creating new templates, click on the New Project Template button on the top left-hand side, and a modal will appear where the user can input a name for the template along with a project type. Project types can also be configured by selecting Edit Values in the event that you need to add or remove any project types. Project type is not required and can always be changed or set once the template is created, as you see here. Down here, you'll see our Basic Settings tab. This will include any of the fields and data that are available on the first tab of a project. This will include general settings like project type, cost centers, notes, and any custom fields. The Teams tab will allow you to create a team that will always be included on this type of project. Rates can also be configured on a project template. This will be especially useful if you have common, custom rates that you use. You can still copy rates from project to project, but including them on the project template will mean one less step you have to take when setting up billing rates on your projects. Then, after you add the template to the project, adjustments can always be made if needed. Since I am Premier, you'll see cost rates and expense rates, and these will only apply to our Premier firms. Lastly, we have tasks or phases that can be added to the template. This screen will act just as the existing task editor on a project does. Tasks can be entered directly to the screen, or a task can be added via the Add Task button below. Within the Tasks section, you can include as much data as you can on a regular task. This means budgets, assignments, custom fields, fee types, and so on, and I can also configure my task editor to include additional information. After all the data has been entered for the template, you can go ahead and click Save. And then to view the list of templates, you can click on the hamburger on the top left-hand side. It might be a little bit harder to see in my screen, but now you'll see all of those templates appear here. The project template grid will include the following columns. Template name, the date the template was created, who it was created by, last modified, modified by whom, and a few actions that I'll touch on in one second. Coming April of 2022, you will also have the ability in your grid configuration to include a template description. That way, you can start being more intentional with how these templates are being utilized and what they contain. You'll see under Actions that you can edit an existing template. I can also copy an existing template if you know that this template is going to operate the same for another project type, but maybe a few items need to be updated under the settings. And you can also recycle or erase any templates. Templates can also be edited by clicking on the template name. Once I've completed creating my templates, it is then time to actually apply a template to a project. So that when I go to my company project list, I can select Add New Project, and there's going to be an additional field for the project template here. With a template selected, once the project is added, any data from that template will be applied to the project. You will also be able to edit and add any data to the new project. Using the template does not limit the user to only that data. This is used as a helpful starting point for the project manager or system admin to speed up the project creation process. One thing to note is that if you are a system administrator, you will have access to creating templates. However, if a user has the ability to create new projects, then when they select Add Project from My Company Projects, they will be able to see the templates drop down in order to apply a template. But anyone outside of a system admin will not have access to actually create templates under My Company Project Templates. As I mentioned in the beginning, project templates are available to both our Pro and Premier users. And once you've added a project template to a project, you can adjust the data after the project has been created. That completes our walkthrough of project templates. Thank you!
