Hi there everyone. Let's go ahead and create a time and materials invoice. First I'll navigate into my WIP tile and either click the checkbox of the project I'm billing and then click create selected invoice or I can click the blue hyperlinked WIP. Both will take you to the same place. One thing to note, you do have the ability to create bulk invoices by selecting multiple projects and clicking bulk create invoices. This will allow you to select the type of invoices or choose the project default denoted in the default invoice type field at the project level. For TNM invoices you will then choose how those invoices are subtotaled. I will go ahead and click into my WIP for Cardiff Electric and it's going to populate the screen that shows how much billable time and expenses are in the WIP. Also which bill rate is selected and the type and details of the last invoice you created for this project. By clicking the create invoice drop down I can choose what type of calculator I'd like to utilize to create this invoice. I'll select time and materials. On the left you'll notice the base rate type set at the project level. Changing the rate will recalculate the invoice against the new rate. You'll also see the invoice date range which allows you to drop any time and expense outside the specified date range. Otherwise all WIP will be pulled onto the invoice. The summary and subtotal setting is strictly to tell BigTime how you'd like to subtotal that invoice. No subtotal shows professional fees for time and reimbursable expenses for expenses. Do note that any selection of these options will change the line items of the invoice to reflect that choice. If you're doing any sort of budgeting and you're utilizing T&M type invoices be sure to subtotal your invoice by task to accurately pull against those task budgets. Our invoice notes pull directly from the project level or you can manually add your own here. And if you have pending approval set up you can select to bill only approved time and expenses. You also have the ability to populate line item notes denoted at the task level. In the event that you need to add a discount or additional line items click the add more lines button. You can then input discount as the line item and a negative amount to include the discount itself. Once everything looks good you can then finalize your invoice and you've now created a draft T&M invoice. Based on your subtotal settings we will pull the quantity, rate, and amount. If I click on this red arrow under amount we will pull in the quantity, rate, and amount but also you can select description only which only shows the amount of the line items. Sales tax info which allows you to denote whether or not that line item is taxable. Note for single rate tax style that rate will be set at the bottom of the invoice. And line item rate style will have a tax drop down for each line item. And then lastly item and links specifically if you're creating any invoices that have tasks on them and you've linked them on your task editor to a specific service item that will populate here or you can select it here for posting purposes. The term field will also be important for utilizing a retainer workflow which we'll cover in future sessions. I will go ahead and save my changes but you can also toggle auto save on or off. On the right you'll see we have the invoice number which will pull directly from the auto numbering set up in your default configuration. You can pick up any unbilled time or expenses. For example you generated this invoice but two days later you have more time logged. You can pick up any unbilled time or expenses for this project and include them on this invoice. Note this is only capable of being done for T&M invoices. PO number pulls directly from the project set up if you utilize that custom field. Otherwise you can input it here manually. And terms come directly from your accounting system or you can set them up in your field values. Draft date is going to be the date that you drafted this invoice. But if you go into the status dropdown you'll see the statuses we've previously discussed. Whether you email the invoice from BigTime or you post the invoice to QuickBooks or Sage these statuses will update automatically. The only one that doesn't is if it's disputed because BigTime just cannot auto determine that. One thing to note is that if you don't have a cent date the QuickBooks or Sage posting date will pull in the draft date. But if you add a cent date it will pull in the cent date depending on your integration settings. We can take a look at those in the invoicing tab. Then you can either pull the cent date or the draft date when posting the invoice to QuickBooks or Sage. I will go back. The due date will be based on the terms selected above. Discussing BigTime Wallet again, if you do utilize Wallet we will allow you to designate the acceptance of ACH or credit card payments as well as getting a payment link you can share with the client. Keep in mind anyone with this link will also have access to the invoice and the accompanying information. Before we send the invoice I want to look at the PDF selection. Going to preview we'll see a drop down of those PDF styles that came from your invoicing configure tab. Remember you can toggle them on or off and here we'll give you a preview of what the invoice will look like to the customer. BigTime will also remember the PDF you utilized when previously sending an invoice for this project auto-populating the same template for that next invoice. You can also take a snapshot in the event you want to store a copy of this invoice to compare against any changes you may make. You can download or delete the snapshot. If there's typical documentation you normally send out with your invoices attach any of those items here. And if you have pending approval set up you can also forward this invoice to review along with any notes for that reviewer. If you recognize any errors in your invoice you can recreate the invoice which is essentially like an undo button for the whole invoice it will take you back to this last page of the invoice creation wizard to make any of those changes. However if you delete an invoice the WIP is not deleted from BigTime and instead just goes back to your WIP tile so do not worry about deleting an invoice. On the time and expense tabs are going to be all the time and expense entries included on this invoice. You can click into the blue hyperlinks to update for example right up or down the input versus billable hours or denote the entry has no charge and the same for your expenses. Back on the invoice detail page you'll notice on the top right there's a few buttons you can select. You have the print icon which allows you to print a PDF asking you to select a style before you do so. You can also export to a Word document to make any formatting changes. Posting I'll touch on in a second. You can also apply a payment directly from the invoice. Do make sure you post the invoice to your accounting system prior to receiving payment. Even if you're emailing the invoice from BigTime and utilizing BigTime Wallet the first thing you should do is post the invoice to your accounting system. And lastly you can email this invoice from BigTime. Here you'll see who the invoice is coming from, your contacts based on the setup of your client, also in the drop down on the invoice detail page you can choose the contact and their address here. As you'll see we do pull in your billing and primary contacts from the project. You can also CC or BCC someone else and if there is an email not already included as a contact on the project you can add a new contact here. The subject line and message auto populate based on your email settings but you also have the option to manually adjust them accordingly. You can also format those attachments in your invoice email as well. You're now ready to send the invoice by selecting email invoice or email and post invoice in one fell swoop. But you can also choose to email yourself a preview copy before sending to the actual client. I mentioned the importance of posting your invoice to your accounting system first so by clicking the cloud icon it'll take you to the posting wizard. First make sure your project is linked to a corresponding project in your accounting system via that customer job link at the project level. If it is correctly linked this bill too will auto populate with the correct project location in your accounting system. All your line items need to be linked to a service item whether that's already linked at the task level or selected manually at the time of posting. Under this red arrow in the amount field BigTime will ask you the details you'd like to send to QuickBooks. Normally it's the default format but you can also share the time and expense detail with staff, no staff, as well as time summary and expense detail format. It's a personal preference for the detail pushed to your accounting system otherwise you can keep the default format. On the left you'll also see the additional info pulled from the invoice itself. And when you're ready to post you can click post to QuickBooks, it'll let you know if it posts successfully or highlight a field in red if something needs to be changed before posting. That completes our walkthrough of the creation and posting of a time and materials invoice. Thank youÂ«
