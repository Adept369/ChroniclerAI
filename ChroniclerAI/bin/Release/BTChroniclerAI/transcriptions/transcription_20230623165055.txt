Today we'll walk through activating skills in your big time site, configuring your skills list and assigning skills on a staffer level. If you are a premier level user, you will have access to skills matching within your big time site. Skills matching is a method of matching and assigning staffers to a project based on the skills and expertise required for the roles needed for the project. Skills matching provides a more efficient process when searching for which staffers are both qualified and available for a project. When activating skills in your big time site, you first need to ensure that you're in the vibrant mode as you see here. In order to activate vibrant mode, you can come up to my company, my company, and on the left hand side, you can activate vibrant. If you are already in vibrant mode, you can then come to my company, my company, active features, and you can ensure that you have skills toggled on. Activating the skills feature here will then add this skills tab to the my company list as you see here. And this is where skills are created for your firm. The skills created here is a list you will then assign to your staffers. On the staff record, when you go to my staff list, there will be an additional tab called skills, which is where you will actually assign those skills that have been created in your firm. Then you'll be able to assign a rating of that skill for the staffer, upload certifications, set expiration dates, and assign an industry to which that staffer has experience in that skill when you take on a new project. But before we get started, it's important to set up the user permissions. By coming to my company user rights and clicking into your user groups, you'll now see a new dropdown for skills. First, we have skill list, which is the actual act of managing the skills that you've configured, which we'll walk through. And then the staff skills are the ability to actually assign staffers to specific skills. Admins have the ability to decide who has access to the firm skill list and whether or not they can view, manage, or delete skills. And they also have access to the staff skills list, where they can view, manage, and remove staff skills. As always, clicking on the question mark will give you a brief explanation of what user right this skill falls under and how it works. Next, we'll actually walk through the act of setting up our skills list configuration. There are two additional field values that can be used with skills matching, neither of which are required. However, they provide an added level of grouping and organization when creating and assigning skills. By coming to My Company, Field Values, when I click into Field Values, you will see two new field values that you can create, Industry Type as well as Skill Category Type. Skills categories can be used however the firm decides to use it. For example, a skill category could be something like project management, technical skills, or human resources. And Industry Type can be configured for the firm, which are then used when assigning a skill to a staffer. Industry Type allows administrators and staff managers to further define and characterize that staffer's skill by specifying where their expertise is. Again, these two field values are not required, but they are encouraged if you would like some additional level of detail and reporting. Next, we'll actually go ahead and create skills for the firm by selecting My Company, Skills. Now that skills have been activated and the field values have been configured, skills can now be created for which will be used for assigning the staffers. From here, you'll be taken to your firm's skills screen, where you can begin to add skills manually by selecting Add Skill on the left-hand side. And you will also have the ability to import a skill list via CSV. A lot of organizations and or firms typically do this on an Excel sheet now. However, BigTime will allow you to import that CSV directly in to your skills view here. But let's talk about how to add a single skill first. To add a new skill, you'll click Add Skill, and a pop-up will appear so you can begin to fill in the details of the skill here. Skill name is just the general name of the skill, which is a required field. In this case, I'm going to go ahead and put Coder. Skill type determines the type of skill so you can categorize and organize the skill list. It will be one of the following, Skill, Certification, Language, and Other. Please note that this is not a configurable list, but this is a required field. Skills category, as mentioned, is not a required field. However, you can assign a category to the skill to further group, define, and organize that skill list. And as I showed you, this is a configurable list in the field values. You can also assign a rating of 1 to 5 for this skill, which I'll show you when we actually go ahead and assign the skill to a staffer. But if you know that you're taking on a technical skills type project and you have an individual that's leaning on a 2 to 3 versus 4 to 5, you may be more inclined to put the person that has a 4 to 5 skill rating on that project as somebody who may have a lower rating. Expires yes or no. Does this skill require an expiration date? This might be most commonly applied for the certification skill type. And then roles, this is going to be the default role that pulls from your list of project roles within the firm. If a skill has a role or roles assigned to it, then any staffer with that default role will automatically have that skill added to their skill list. And then you can also input a description of the skill. Once I select add, you'll see that new skill below is added. Skills can always be edited or deleted from the firm. When editing or deleting a skill, clicking save after making a change will warn the user if the skill is applied to any staffers so they can decide if they want to continue with that action. As mentioned above, a skill list can also be imported into BigTime from a CSV file. By clicking on the import CSV button, this will begin the process. Since the import function requires a particular format, we have provided a template that should be used if they want to import their skill list by selecting download our CSV template here. Once you've entered in your data into the file, you can save it and upload the file from the choose a file button here and then click import skills. If there are any errors during the import, a few things will happen. One, we will skip any of the failed rows and continue to import the successes. Two, once completed, BigTime will let the user know their import is finished and that there were failures with the import. And three, we'll provide a file they can download to see all of the line items that failed and why. Just a few reasons why a file would fail to import would be missing required fields such as name and or type fields. If a value is incorrect, there's a duplicate skill, columns are in the wrong order, or values are over the character limit. Skill name is 512 characters and description is 1024. The skill list page can also be configured to show various fields related to that skill and users can decide which they want to have appear on that screen. Like anything else in BigTime, by clicking on the gear icon here, you can configure your view and then this will make the change across all of your users that have access to this view. For example, I can add in the rating, if it's expiring, the category or staff list, and once you apply, your view will reset here with the newly selected fields that you've added. The number of staff icon to the right includes a link the user can select to see which staffers are assigned to that skill. By clicking on the number, the pop-up will include the ability to click a link to go directly to the staffers skill screen or the staffers manage skill screen. Please note, if you are a user that does not have permission to manage staff skills, you will not see the link to manage skills here. The skills list also includes a search function and the option to export the list to a PDF or Excel file. Now that the skills have been created, skills can now be assigned to the staffers. If skills is enabled, then there's now an additional tab, as I mentioned before, on each staff record for assigning skills. By clicking my company, staff list, I can select any staffer and I can now see that skills tab here. When you click on the skills tab for a user, you'll see a blank row so that you can start adding skills for that staffer. One thing to note is that if you only have the view staffer skills permission, then this list will be read only. You can see that Alexi has some pre-existing skills. However, I also have the option to click into this blank row and I can go ahead and add in that new skill I've selected. You'll see that the rest of the information that I input in that basic form that populated earlier will show here. Because I said that this skill has a rating, I can choose to assign a rating as well. You'll also see when that skill has been added. If it has an expiration date because it's a certification. Once I save, you'll see that you have the ability to upload a file, especially if you need to house their certification or documentation that comes with that specific certification. For tracking purposes, if any new skills have been added or updated, this information will populate on the top right-hand corner. Some things to know with adding new skills is that the date added is not configurable. You can see that I added Coder to Alexi's profile today. Category is configured in the field values and I can also select it here. Category is configured in the field values but not editable on this screen as it is assigned to the skill when creating it. Type will auto-fill based on the skills you selected when creating your skill list. The type for each skill is managed when adding that skill to the firm. As I mentioned, the certification skill type does include the ability to upload a file allowing users to store that staffer's certification. File uploads are only available for the certification skill type. After a file has been uploaded, the file will then be accessible to view by clicking on the paper icon that populates here upon uploading. When I upload a file, you can go ahead and choose that file. You can also add multiple skills. Skills can be assigned using the add multiple new skills button. This gives managers and admins the opportunity to quickly assign skills to a staffer to speed up the process. Then after the skills have been added, they can go back to the manage skill screen to input the rest of the details such as the rating, expiration date, and or upload a file. I can add skills in all at one time. However, if Alexi already possesses a skill, it will not allow you to add a duplicate. Then I can save and any new skills that I've added will be accessible within Alexi's skills tab here. The skill list can also be searched on this screen as well. When you begin the search, the screen will filter to only show skills that fall within that search. This way you can quickly add and find a skill. If they see the skills not in the list, you can go ahead and add a new skill to the right-hand side. The same form will populate as it did when you were in my company skills tab. Now if I go back to my staff list, once you've assigned the skills to your staffers, you can also use this skill search feature to look for staffers within a specific set of skills. Earlier, I told you that you can have default roles set up so that those skills that you've assigned to that default role will populate. And then after selecting your skills, the filter staff list that displays will be based off of that skill search. And if at least one of the selected skills is entered, we will go ahead and show you on this list. The selections are based or a group, I should say, by skill type. So you can go ahead and actually enter in as many skills as you would like during your search. Using the gear icon on the right-hand side, the grid can be configured to display each of the staffers' skills. So you can then see a new column that shows skills separated by commas. And then lastly, with our version one of skills matching, any report type that contains the staff details will now have a new field for the skill list. For example, I'm going to go ahead and just create a staffer report. And you will go ahead and now see this new field called skill list. And by adding this field, it will provide a comma separated list for all of the skills assigned to the staffer in question. So let me go ahead and pull this quick report so you can see, but similar how you notice it was separated by commas in the staff view list. For a report, any report type that contains the staff details has a new field for skill list. So a few things to note. When activating skills matching, one, you need to ensure that you're a Premier user. Two, you need to make sure that you're in vibrant mode. And then three, you actually need to go to my company, my company, active features in order to enable skills matching within your site. Thank you.
