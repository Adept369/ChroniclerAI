Piggybacking off of the timesheet detail report we created in the last session, I want to talk about some of the other useful filters. We've already walked through some of those filters like showing only your assigned tasks in the custom task budget by assigned staff report, showing any unassigned tasks in the custom task budget status report, or only seeing invoice time entries like in the last session. Now we'll cover some different filter comparison types. First I am going to customize this report and actually remove the invoice number, margin, and invoice status columns. And instead I will add the approved yes no column as well as the project manager column. Perfect. Now you have quite a few options in the filtering functionality. So let's say I want to create a report that only shows time data for certain categories. This in comparison will allow me to create a comma separated list of the categories that I want to see. So instead of creating a separate filter for each category I want to see, I can instead use this in comparison to create a list. This is helpful because big time reports can only handle up to a max of about nine separate filters. I will say my category column in, so let's say I only want to see the project scoping and research categories. So the filter is going to read category in project scoping comma space research. Create my report with that filter, create it, rename it, scope and research time, and I'll publish it. Change the date because I don't have time in that field. Perfect. There's one, but let's go back to the beginning of time just to see a few more entries. Perfect. I also see this similarly used with projects, staff members, or clients. Like maybe I only want to see four clients in a single report. The best way to filter that is to use this in comparison instead of creating four separate filters. Go back to editing the report and another very useful filter creates the ability to see a field that returns no values. So go back to my filtering and say, let's say for example, say you forgot to require the category or task field on the time sheet. And you have a set of time entries that need to include the category. Instead of this in comparison, you can use is empty. So you can use this is empty comparison and that will tell the system that you want to see any time entry whose category field is empty. As you'll see, I can't even put a value into this field. Update it. Create my report. No categories, time. Again, we will just go back to the beginning of time and run that report. Now I can see that the report is only pulling time entries that do not have a category assigned to it. That way I can know exactly what entries need updating. The nice thing is you can use these comparisons on any report type. You can filter for the empty task field in an expense type report. Maybe you want to see all the time entries that don't have time sheet notes. You could add the notes column and use the same filter type. You could also do the opposite. Go back to my options, customize my filtering. Maybe you only want to see the time entries that do have a category or task. You would just do the opposite and the comparison would say is not empty. Update that report. Now even in the state range, it is only showing time entries that do include a category. You can also use filters in combination. I previously added the project managers and approved yes no columns. The approved column is saying whether or not the entry has been approved. Say I have a project manager and I want to create a specific report for them to see all the hours that are not yet approved for their projects. What I would do is add the filter that says approved equals no. Then I'm going to add a new blank filter that says project manager contains Jane. The reason that I'm doing contains is because let's say I have a project that has two project managers. If I were to use the equals comparison to say project managers equals Jane Doe, it would actually not include a project that had an additional project manager or team lead. So you want to make sure you say contains so it pulls all projects that she's at least one project manager on. That's one example of how you can use filter combinations. I'll update that, create the report, and retitle it Jane's Approvals. Back to the beginning of time. This report is going to be useful to Jane because she's going to be able to see all the time entries that she specifically has yet to approve on one single screen. Also, during report customization, if you know the filter will return the exact same value on a certain field, like this approved column, you can choose to hide columns that are strictly included for filtering purposes. If I hide the column, I'll save that. I'll publish it again. And now we can just understand instead of being shown that all of these entries have yet to be approved. So because this report is specific to Jane, say I'm ready to share this report with her, I can do that two different ways. I could do that by publishing it to the public reports and giving her user rights permissions to access that folder. You do that by, when you're ready to create the report, selecting the public reports in the publish to section when you're creating the report. If you wanted to further filter who has access to it within those public reports, you could do that by going into your report permissions, customize report permissions, and checking off which user rights group you want to make it available to. The other way you can share reports is by using the My Reports. I'll navigate to edit report settings, and I can say share a copy of this report using these settings, and then choose a report group. Report groups are going to allow you to create custom groups to organize your reports. You can add a new group. You can see I have a few already in existence. Then you can choose which user rights group have access to that particular report group. Once you create your report groups, you'll see them in this shared report group dropdown. I'll add it to the financial group. Anybody within the financials report group will then have access to this report in their My Reports section. I'll go ahead and click run report. If I go to analytics, My Reports tab, you'll see that My Reports is grouped by those report groups that you created. I'm going to navigate back to my report center. The final way to share reports that I think is one of the most useful ways, especially for your project managers, is being able to share them to the project level financials tab. To start, I will create a task type report. I'll add the project name, the task name. To give my PMs some insight to budget status data, I will add the overall estimate, the hourly estimate, the remaining billable hours, the remaining input hours. Then in order to share a report to the financials tab of a project, you'll want to edit your report settings to select a specific project. Then I will update it, create the report. I'll title it Project Financials Status and publish. Perfect. Now that I have that setting selected, you're actually going to close out of this and jump over to the project list. So I can select any project. I will navigate to the financials tab. And then in this dropdown on the right that currently says time and expense by period, here you're going to have the ability to add reports. All the reports that are available in this list are reports that have the setting to select a specific project. As you can see, I have that Project Financials Status report we just created. I will select that. And I'm going to click Save. Refresh the page. And now I can access that report directly from the project level. This is a global edition, so anytime I jump to a different project, this report will be available. Adding reports to the financials tab is going to be really helpful to give your PMs insight to some data that they may not have direct access to, especially if you're not giving access to the report center. Well, that wraps up our reporting 201 course, and you should now feel comfortable creating task type reports, budgetary reports, invoicing reports, applying specific filters to get certain data, and then sharing those reports. Thank you.
