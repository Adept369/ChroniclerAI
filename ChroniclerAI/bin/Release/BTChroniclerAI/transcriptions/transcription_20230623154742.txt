Hi there everyone. Just know that you will always have big time out of the box reports to utilize or create a copy of to make any adjustments or customizations. These out of the box reports can never be deleted. But alternatively, you can also start from scratch with a custom report. First we'll click into this magnifying glass tile and then the blue create your report link. If you scroll down a little bit and under the other information section, you will see the task type report. You'll also see task by assigned staff member and then a task summary report. We're going to go through each one. So again, if you're referring to tasks as phases or to do's, you'll see that same verbiage reflected in place of task for these report types. So I've chosen that task type and I'll click next. This will open up to a blank slate that I can add any available fields I'd like to see. In this case, I'll add the project name and the task name to start with. But before we start scrolling through the list of available columns, I do want to highlight this task details section. This section of columns is going to pull all the details and settings you've added for that particular task. So you can see the start date and the due dates, if the task is yours with this my task yes no field, or if it's not been assigned yet. If you're utilizing those task types and statuses, you'll be able to apply that field as well. And you can even review the fee type, which is directly related to the item based billing calculator. But one of the fields I really like to point out is this percent completed field. The percent completed column is going to be pulling the percent complete that is input on the actual task. So if I actually open up my task dashboard in another tab, I will show you exactly what I'm referring to. So I'll just open up a task and we are already on the budget dates sub tab. If you do look at this percent complete field, this could be a manual entry. So I'll type in 70. By doing that, if I'm doing fixed fee percent complete billing, that 70% will automatically fill in when I create that invoice. Or the other way around, if you're doing percent complete and you input 70% on the actual invoice, that will automatically update this field at the task level. So that's the task level data that pulls directly onto the report for this specific percent completed field. However, we do have fields that will actually calculate it for you, which we'll take a look at in a bit. But for the layout of the report, I'm actually going to scroll down near the task and QB data section. This would actually be useful if you're linking your tasks to a QuickBooks class or a QuickBooks item set in the accounting tab of the task. Let me show you where that's at really quick. Right here in the accounting sub tab, here is that service item in the QuickBooks class. But first, we will want to include some static budget data. Estimates are pulled directly from what budgets you've input to that task. So again, we'll take a look at a task back in the budget dates section. You'll see that you have an hours budget, a fee budget, as well as an expense budget. Now on the report, this estimate field is going to be a combination of that fee estimate and expense estimate. But say you only want to see one or the other, like if you only use a fee estimate, you can select that option. And you can also view the hourly estimate. I'll include that as well. Next, you can actually see who is assigned to those tasks under this user assignments section. This will actually show the full name of that staffer who's assigned. But say you need to see all the tasks that are unassigned. You can then add this unassigned field, then create a filter by navigating options, customize filtering. And the literal filter would be unassigned equals yes. And that would show you all the tasks that are not yet assigned. Now under the task details section, you'll get into budget status information. Many of these columns are calculations of system data. And any time you hover over those fields, it'll give you the exact calculation formula. So say that I want to see my hourly estimate minus the input hours to date. That would be this hours remaining field. The nice thing about these fields, like all the time type and project type reports, you can see information regarding input hours and billable hours separately. So it really depends on the end goal of the report to include exactly what values you'd like to pull. Input hours are going to include billable and non-billable hours. But if you only care about what you're actually billing to your clients, you can add any of those billable hours fields. So far, we've added the fee estimate, the hour estimate. Let's say I want to see the charges remaining. So pulling the estimate minus the input charges. Before we do that, one thing to note is that I previously added the fee estimate field. However, this charges remaining column, it would be looking at the total estimate field. Only in the case that I had a task with both a fee and an expense estimate would I include this charges remaining estimate minus input charges. But then instead of including just the fee estimate column, I'd probably include the overall estimate field, which is this one. But because I'm just looking at the fee estimate, I will add the charges remaining, fee estimate minus input fees. Again, both billable and non-billable hours are calculated against the billing rate for that project to get the input fees. And be sure to include expense fields if you're using expense estimates. Next, you'll see that percent completed again. As I mentioned earlier, there's the percent completed field in the task details column section that is pulled directly from the task level. But there are also these calculated fields that divide the input charges by the dollars estimated. That will calculate the task's exact completion percentage. So I'll add that. Then you get into more calculated fields for those percentages, actuals versus earned. Next, you'll really start to get into any allocation info. So if you're on the Premier level subscription, you'll see the fields for those allocated hours. The nice thing about these task reports is it's going to give you those total allocated hours as opposed to some of those allocation reports where it's going to give you a breakdown per period of time. So if you care more about seeing the overall data, these task type reports are going to be really helpful. Then you can see some more allocation data like allocated fees and costs as well as the projected fees, anything like that. But these task type reports aren't just limited to pulling in data just based on the estimates. You can actually see transactional data. So I will scroll down to the total activity to date section. Like if you wanted to see the total amount of input fees that have been tracked towards a specific task, these total activity fields won't give a breakdown for specific time entries, but will instead show overall activity logged against this task to date. One thing to note with task type reports, all the activity or transactional data will be to date as opposed to data from a specified date range. Another thing I like to point out about activity data is that in order for fields like under this timesheet activity to date section, say the total input hours or the total input fees to be accurate, you'll want to make sure that your staff are actually tracking time to those tasks. Because this is a task type report, we want to see data that is tracked towards those tasks. So I always recommend requiring the task field on your timesheets if that's something you care about with these reports. Continue scrolling through the list and you'll see that there are fields around invoicing. We'll get to that in a moment as I just kind of want to keep this report fairly simple for now. But as you scroll through, you'll also see that you can add custom field columns. So any custom field you've configured on your tasks, you can add that info to these reports. And just like the timesheet activity, you can see expense activity as well. After you get through the expense activity, you'll start to see data revolving around your projects. You can pull in any project details you want, maybe something revolving around your cost centers. Again, if you have any custom fields on your projects, you can add all those fields to this task type report. And that's the nice thing about these reports is even though a lot of data is specific to tasks, you can pull in other data. You'll also see that there are a lot of fields that are on various report types. Take this My Project Role section, for instance. This section is on all the report types that we have. You can see which projects are assigned to you, if you're the team lead, and what your role is on that project. You can even use these for filtering purposes, like if you're running a report for yourself and you only want to see projects that you are assigned to. Lastly, you can include any client, contact, or project team information as well. I always like to point out the drill down links. So you'll notice in these sessions that we do mention some of the same things in each one. We do that because some features may be relevant in more than one situation. Like if I'm running a time detail or an expense report, I can still use similar filters or settings from a task report. So this drill down link will really allow you to access the data directly from the report without having to navigate away from it or lose your spot. You can always add a drill down link that will open up directly to the location that you set in this dropdown. So in this task name field, we will choose to open directly to the task. So if I see that I need to make any additional changes or if I just want to see the details, I can do that directly from the report. The next thing that I like to highlight is the ability to create what we call super headers. First, I'm going to actually adjust the location of some of these fields so it's more organized. I like to group each cluster of columns based on their estimate type. So I will actually move the estimate down by the monetary fields. And then because I have my total hours input, I'll move that up to the hourly estimate group and save. Now that I better organized my report, I will further organize it by utilizing something that we call super headers. First, we'll actually click this link to activate the column groups. Then when you click into any of the fields, you'll be able to click right above this header and type in whatever you'd like that super header to be. Type in hours. Save my changes. Once you click save, you'll see that these arrows you can use to drag the super header across any column that you'd like. So I'm going to drag it across the remaining hours and the total hours. This way, when I run this report, I can see the hourly information all grouped under this header. Now I'll actually add an additional header as well. I'll call this one fees. And again, going to do the same thing and extend these across all the fee-oriented columns. Again, you can use these super headers on any report type. This is really just an example that I like to use. Next, I can add another level of grouping to this report. I'm going to apply a grouping by project so I can see the subtotal values for each individual project. I will navigate options, customize grouping, and then say project, and I'll add that group in subtotal. If you wanted to add an additional level of grouping, you could do that too. But I will just press update my report to save my new grouping so that this way, when I'm running the report, the grouping allows me to see individual task level data group by project along with the subtotal of that total task data per project. I am now done, so I'll create the report, title it task budget status, and publish it under my budgeting planning section. Once published, you can see the applicable groupings by project, the individual task data, as well as the subtotal of that data per project. You can also see those super headers. Here it's grouped by the hourly entries and the fee entries, making it easier to visualize that data. And you can also see that I added the drill down link. So each of the tasks has their own drill down link that will open up to that particular task. That way, I can view any additional data, jump to the budget states tab, or the accounting tab and make any changes that I need. Those changes will then immediately take effect on the report. And that is the walkthrough and creation of a custom task budget status report. You should now feel comfortable utilizing a task type report to gain insight into your task budgetary data and customizing the report in an efficient format by implementing grouping, drill down links, and super headers. Thank you.
