Now that we have walked through the configuration process for BigTimes Wallet Solution, you are ready to send out invoices to your clients with the wallet payment link. We will walk through a demonstration of how you send out an invoice to clients with the wallet link and how your clients can make a payment. You can select any invoice within BigTime and proceed to the main detail page. Once you are there, you can refer to the bottom right section of this page where payment info is listed. The checkboxes displayed here indicating Allow ACH or Allow Credit Card are the determining factors as to whether the wallet payment link will be included in the invoice. In order for a client to make an online payment, one or both of these methods must be selected with the changes saved and updated. If you would like to override the default payment methods you set up during the configuration process, you will need to either have AutoSave turned on once you've enabled one or both of the payment methods or come down here to select Save Changes. Once you are settled with what payment methods you wish to offer the client for this specific invoice, for QuickBooks users, you will want to ensure that you post the invoice to QuickBooks first by selecting the cloud button with the upward pointing arrow. Once you've posted the invoice, you can proceed to send out the invoices to your clients. There are two ways for you to send the invoice with the wallet link to them. One is the Get Payment link. This is a viable option for those of you that utilize a chat feature such as Slack to communicate with your clients or already have a set email template and just wish to send a payment URL. In addition, in instances where the client walks into your office and hands you a credit card, this is your quickest option as you just need to open this link in a new browser tab, enter the payment information, and proceed to complete the payment. Again, what the client sees in terms of payment methods is specified under this Payment Info section right here. So I can see Allow ACH or Credit Card, or I would only see one if only one is selected. You can also email the invoice with the Payment Link. This is the more common option where you can send out an email to your client with the automatic checkbox that allows users to view and pay this invoice online embedded into the email. You can configure the subject line and message template to your liking and select which personnel you wish to send the invoice to. Once you are comfortable with your message and have specified who to send the email to, you can proceed to email the invoice. In this instance, I have already done so, so you will see when it was last emailed, but you will also see an immediate notification on this Invoice Details screen indicating that the invoice email has been sent. In addition, you will see this update in the Activity Feed as well. However, it's important to note one thing. In order for the Payment Link to be available and for clients to submit payments via the Payment Link, one or both of the payment methods here must be selected. If you were to uncheck both payment options and select Save, you'll notice that the Payment Link option is gone and no longer visible, nor is the default section to allow users to view or pay this invoice online selected. I also want to bring your attention to a newer feature that when you are emailing the invoice out, if you haven't already posted the invoice, we will allow you to email and post the invoice at the same time because remember, in order for the transactions to funnel through accordingly for your QuickBooks integration, that invoice does need to be posted prior to collecting payment. If you've already done so, you'll also have the ability to just email the invoice. Once the invoice email has been sent out, within a minute or so, your client should receive the email in your inbox as you see here. And the email will contain the exact message template you specified, as well as any attachments you have included, and the invoice PDF. The main thing to notice is this Pay Invoice button. Selecting this will automatically direct your client to the payment landing page where they can view the invoice and submit payment. Notice that once the landing page opens up, the payment methods they have available to them as I showed you before will show up here. To complete the payment, your client simply needs to enter the required information and then submit payment. The payment should be submitted within a few seconds, and as soon as completed, they will see a transaction ID that has been generated for this specific transaction. In the instance that your client chooses to make payment over two transactions, maybe they decide to split it up, please note that the two separate transaction IDs will be generated, resulting in two separate transaction fees. Once they have made the payment, they can download a copy of the receipt for their records, as well as a copy of the invoice. As soon as your client has submitted the payment, you will be flagged a notification on the top right-hand side within BigTime indicating that the client has submitted payment. In my instance, you won't see that notification, but if you have a client that has submitted payment, you will see this in your BigTime site notifications, and that notification will specify the invoice and the total amount. In addition, as soon as the payment is made, it will also be applied in BigTime, and the balance will update in real-time on your invoice detail page. When you open the notification tab, you will also see the option to click here to view all payments, which will redirect you to the invoice payment page that contains only payments that were made via the wallet link. You can also get to this page by selecting Invoicing in BigTime and then the Payments option. One thing to note around notifications is that financial admins will also be notified when a client's wallet payment has been voided or refunded. As soon as payments are made, they will be visible in this pending payments page here. Notice that you can verify the individual transaction based on the transaction ID displayed here that the client would have seen earlier in the payment landing page as soon as he or she has submitted payment. Depending on the payment method, the transaction will sit in the pending page between 2 to 5 business days until the payment has been deposited into the bank account. Once the payment has been deposited, the transaction will move from this pending payments page to the payment history page. In addition, you can always click on the transaction ID and it will give you the option to go to the invoice detail for this particular invoice that the transaction was tied to and you can see the balance due amount is now $0 as well. Please note that if I go back to the pending payments page, sometimes you will need to select Refresh Pending Payments to see new transactions and to see transactions move to the payment history. For QuickBooks desktop users, please note that in order for payments to flow through to QuickBooks, the sync agent must be run and for QuickBooks online users, the payments will flow through instantly. With BigTime Wallet, one component to the payment experience that lies completely within the hands of the payment processor is the batching process. Batching entails recording multiple invoices and payments into one lump sum deposit. The way that wallet deposits work is that you will see deposits made into the bank account you specified during your wallet application. However, due to the batching process in ACH payments and credit card payments taking varied times to deposit, your bank deposits will sometimes comprise of a varying number of payments. It could be an individual payment, but more often than not will contain multiple. In order to view what payments comprise the particular deposit you see in your bank account, you can click on the report section within BigTime and then select the Report Center option. In our next video, we will walk through some of the BigTime Wallet reports that are available for you to view. Thank you.
