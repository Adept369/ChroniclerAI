In this video, I'm going to go ahead and apply a payment in QuickBooks so that you can see how it posts over into big time. My payment amount is going to be the full amount due on this invoice, and I'm going to add in a reference number. And I'm going to say that it's cash, and then save. Now when I close this out, I'm going to go back to my customers, and I can see that new payment because the invoice type shows payment, my reference number, and the amount. When I click into here, it will take me back to that payment screen where I can go ahead and see that that payment was received from my Whole Foods advertising project, the payment amount, the date, and the reference number. I'm going to run a quick sync, and then we'll take a look at what it looks like in big time. So that when I open up my big time, I'm going to go into invoicing overview, and we'll see that that invoice number 127 is no longer my AR because it's been paid. So I'm going to go into my company project list and select my advertising project. And if I click the three dots and select billing history, I can see the invoice number and that there's no balance because if I click in here, I can see that there was a payment totaling $3,000. And in the activity feed, I can also see that a payment was applied in QuickBooks. And if I click into here, it's going to pull up that reference number, the payment date, and the total amount due, as well as the payment type and where that cash was deposited to before they go ahead and make a journal entry to move that cash into their AR account.
