Hi there, everyone. Today we're going to walk through the creation and workflow of a holdback invoice. This type of invoice is most commonly used on government, engineering, or general contractor type jobs where a certain percentage of each invoice is held back and then a final invoice is sent for the total holdback amounts after the client has accepted the work as being completed. The BigTime Holdback Calculator uses the standard time and materials format but holds back a percentage of the time charges. That holdback amount is denoted in a custom field on your project details screen where you'll input the percentage of each invoice you'd like to hold back for that project. Once you've completed the work and invoiced for that work, you will then use the Final Holdback Calculator to bill for the total amount of charges that have been held back throughout the duration of the project. First, we will need to navigate to the Invoicing Configure tab to enable the holdback and final holdback calculators. We'll click on the Calculators tab, and if you don't automatically see the holdback calculators, click on this gallery of specialized calculators at the bottom of the window. You should now see both calculators and can click Import to activate them within your site. You'll now see them active in your list of calculators. Now we will navigate to the project we will be holding back charges for. Once you navigate to the project, click on the Details tab and scroll to the bottom. Here you'll see a newly created custom field called Holdback Percent. This is where you'll input the percentage of each invoice that will be held back. For example, I'll put 10 here and save my changes. We are now ready to start the invoicing process. We'll navigate back to the Invoicing Overview page, and you can either click into the WIP tile to select the project there or click the Create Invoice button. I'll click Create Invoice and select the project I'm invoicing for, click Next, and then we're going to select the Holdback Calculator. Here you can see all the fees included as a line item. This line item description can be altered, just like the normal T&M calculator, by changing the subtotaling setting on the left. I'm going to choose Subtotal by Staff. Now the expense line item is not being held back as the calculator only holds back time charges. And this locked line item is the 10% of the time charges being subtracted or held back from the invoice. This is pulled directly from the custom field at the project level. Do note that changing the holdback percentage here in the upper left of the Invoice Wizard does change the percentage at the project level and would hold that new percentage amount back on any new holdback invoices created for this project. As mentioned, this holdback line item is locked and the amount can be altered by changing that holdback percent field. If you so desire, you'll be able to change the name of the line item once you've finalized this invoice. Once everything's all set, we can then click Finalize, and you've now created a holdback invoice. Now let's fast forward and act as if we've completed the work to be done and are ready to invoice for the total charges held back throughout the life of this project. We can navigate to the Invoicing Overview page, and I'll click Create Invoice. Select the project we're billing the total holdback amount for. Click Next. Now instead of the regular holdback calculator, we will use the final holdback calculator to bill everything that's been held back. Click Next. And now on the final stage of the Invoicing Wizard, you'll see the final holdback charges that have accumulated throughout the life of this project. You can also see on the left that you have the ability to attach or clear any WIP from the project on this final invoice. We will click Finalize, and you've now created a final invoice to charge the total amount held back for a completed project. That concludes our walkthrough of the holdback invoice workflow. You should now feel comfortable utilizing the holdback and final holdback calculators to hold a certain percentage of each invoice back on a project, and then invoice for that total held back amount. Thank you.
