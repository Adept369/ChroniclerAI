Hi there everyone. In today's session, we will walk through the creation and editing of a manual invoice. You may want to create a manual invoice for a specific dollar amount apart from billing time and expenses. Perhaps you need to invoice for the deposit against a retainer in the apply retainer or deposit invoicing workflows, or you've made a purchase on behalf of a client and are invoicing for reimbursement. The manual invoice option makes it easy to create and edit one-off invoices. To start, we'll click on the invoicing tab in the navigation bar and select overview. Click the create invoice button at the top left of the screen. Choose the job that you're creating an invoice for. Once you have selected a job, click the next button at the bottom right of the screen. Select manual invoice for the type of invoice you'd like to create. Do note that the manual calculator is a default calculator within the system and cannot be turned off. Once you've selected manual invoice, go ahead and click the next button. Here you will fill in the details and amount of your manual invoice. You can add a description or notes to your invoice line items. And in the case that you need to add more line items, you can click the add more lines button and input whatever else needs to be included on this invoice. Once you've input all the proper line item information, click the finalize button at the bottom right of the screen. And you've now created a manual invoice. Should you need to edit that invoice after it's been drafted but prior to being sent to the client, like in the case of adding a new line item or editing an existing one, we will click on the invoicing tab in the navigation bar and overview. Click on the drafts tile. Find the invoice that you'd like to edit and then click on that invoice's dollar amount. This will open the invoice detail page and allow you to edit the invoice details. I'll change this amount to 750. And once you've made the changes to the invoice, don't forget to click the save changes button at the bottom right of the screen. You should now feel comfortable creating and editing a manual invoice for a specific dollar amount. Thank you.
